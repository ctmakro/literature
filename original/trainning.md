# How to live

To live, you need resources.

To obtain resources, you need money(exchange medium). You can't produce everything you need by yourself.

To exchange for money, you need wealth(valuable stuff), what others consume as resources.

To get wealth, either you create it yourself, or get it from elsewhere.

Both creator and merchant have to make sure they provide something people want. What people don't want is not wealth(not valuable).

To provide something people want, you must provide it cheaper than other providers, or in better quality, or both.

As a creator, to create something cheaper and/or better than existing product, you need better technology.

To obtain better technology, you could learn from sources of better technology, and/or develop the technology yourself.

To learn from sources of better technology, you could go to University, work in companies or learn from masters(guru).

Universities develop better technology but rarely protect them. They are backed by the nation to provide a stable source of better technology. Companies develop better technology and they do protect them, since companies are only backed by themselves.

To develop better technology yourself, you could start from current state-of-the-art, and work very hard on the problem with scientific methods. But again, both scientific methods and (some)state-of-the-art are taught in University. There are examples however, to obtain better technology without using scientific methods, or without starting from current state-of-the-art, but those are very rare and not reproducible.

As a merchant, to get something cheaper or better than other provider, you must know where to find them.

To know places where something is cheaper or better, you need fresher information(than others).

To obtain fresher information, you need communication skills and social relationship. Information about products exist mostly in the brains of those who produce or consume them. E-commerce changed that, but not completely.

To have good communication skills and good social relationship, you must understand people in general.

The fastest way to understand people in general is to study physiology. Again that is taught in University.

So either way you need higher education. There are other ways to live, but higher education is the easiest and most straightforward solution.
