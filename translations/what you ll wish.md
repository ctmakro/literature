What you'll wish you'd known
你将希望你一早知道的事儿

January 2005

(I wrote this talk for a high school. I never actually gave it, because the school authorities vetoed the plan to invite me.)

When I said I was speaking at a high school, my friends were curious. What will you say to high school students? So I asked them, what do you wish someone had told you in high school? Their answers were remarkably similar. So I'm going to tell you what we all wish someone had told us.
我的朋友们听说我要去高中演讲，都感到很好奇。跟高中生有什么好讲的？于是我问他们：假如回到高中，你最希望别人告诉你什么？结果他们的答案惊人地相似。接下来我会告诉你们，我们最希望当年有人能告诉我们的事情。

I'll start by telling you something you don't have to know in high school: what you want to do with your life. People are always asking you this, so you think you're supposed to have an answer. But adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter. They want to know what sort of person you are, and this question is just to get you talking. They ask it the way you might poke a hermit crab in a tide pool, to see what it does.
我先从高中生不需要知道的事情开始。你将来想做什么？身边的人总是问你这个问题，于是你就以为你必须得回答。其实大人问这个问题，只是想开个话茬；他们想知道你是哪种人，所以把这个问题当作话题。这种提问的方法，就如同你在草丛里敲一只蜗牛，再观察它的反应。

If I were back in high school and someone asked about my plans, I'd say that my first priority was to learn what the options were. You don't need to be in a rush to choose your life's work. What you need to do is discover what you like. You have to work on stuff you like if you want to be good at what you do.
如果回到高中，有人问我对未来的计划，我会说我的第一选择，就是搞清楚有哪些选择。你没必要这么早就决定这辈子要干什么。你倒是应该搞清楚你喜欢什么。你必须喜欢做一件事，才有可能成为做这件事的专家。

It might seem that nothing would be easier than deciding what you like, but it turns out to be hard, partly because it's hard to get an accurate picture of most jobs. Being a doctor is not the way it's portrayed on TV. Fortunately you can also watch real doctors, by volunteering in hospitals. [1]
确定自己喜欢什么，听起来是一件再简单不过的事，实际上却很困难，一部分原因是对大部分职业的准确印象很难获取。当一个真正的医生，跟电视剧里演的是两码事。不过还好，如果你想要收看真正的医生，可以去医院当志愿者。

But there are other jobs you can't learn about, because no one is doing them yet. Most of the work I've done in the last ten years didn't exist when I was in high school. The world changes fast, and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up. In such a world it's not a good idea to have fixed plans.
不过，有很多工作我们是没法观看学习的，因为目前还没有人干过。过去十年里我所做的绝大多数工作，在我上高中的时候都是不存在的。世界变得很快，而变化的速度本身也在加快。在这样一个世界里，把自己的计划定的太死是不好的。

And yet every May, speakers all over the country fire up the Standard Graduation Speech, the theme of which is: don't give up on your dreams. I know what they mean, but this is a bad way to put it, because it implies you're supposed to be bound by some plan you made early on. The computer world has a name for this: premature optimization. And it is synonymous with disaster. These speakers would do better to say simply, don't give up.
然而每到五月份，全国各地的学校都会上演《标准毕业演讲》，主题是：不要放弃你的梦想。我知道他们想说什么，但这种表达有问题，因为它暗示着你要跟着你之前定好的计划去走。在计算机领域，这种做法叫做“过早优化”，它的另一个名字叫悲剧。他们如果只说“不要放弃”，其实还好一点。

What they really mean is, don't get demoralized. Don't think that you can't do what other people can. And I agree you shouldn't underestimate your potential. People who've done great things tend to seem as if they were a race apart. And most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems like the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate genius. In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.
他们真正想说的是：不要丧失斗志。别人能做到的，你不要觉得做不到。我确实也认为你们不应该低估自己的潜力。那些成就非凡的人看上去总是与众不同。而绝大多数传记都在放大这种幻觉，一方面是因为传记作者千篇一律的崇拜口吻，一方面是因为在故事结局已知的情况下，他们必须得美化剧情，直到主人公的人生看上去就像天赐的才华加命运的必然。而实际上我怀疑，如果你把16岁的莎士比亚或者爱因斯坦放到这间学校，他们或许会让你印象深刻，但不会跟你的其他朋友有太大区别。

Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our fault if we can't do something as good.
可是这话听着就不舒服了。如果他们跟我们相差无几，那他们要取得他们的成就，就必须要付出超人的努力。这就是为什么我们愿意相信“天才”的存在——它为我们提供了懒惰的借口。假如这些人的伟大成就来自于某种神奇的“爱因斯坦基因”，或者“莎士比亚基因”，那也就不能怪我们一般人做不到了。

I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius. But if you're trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.
我不是说这个世界上不存在“天才”。我是说在大多数情况下，如果一件事有两种解释，其中一种可以给你偷懒的借口，那么另一种就是对的。

So far we've cut the Standard Graduation Speech down from "don't give up on your dreams" to "what someone else can do, you can do." But it needs to be cut still further. There is some variation in natural ability. Most people overestimate its role, but it does exist. If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition was to play in the NBA, I'd feel pretty stupid saying, you can do anything if you really try. [2]
截至目前，我们已经把《标准毕业演说》从“不要放弃你的梦想”削减成了“别人能做你也能做”。但它还得再削减。每个人的天赋总是有一点差别的，虽然大部分人高估了它的影响，但它确实是存在的。假如有个一米五的人跟我说他的梦想是打NBA，那我肯定不会傻傻地跟他说，别人能做你也能做。

We need to cut the Standard Graduation Speech down to, "what someone else with your abilities can do, you can do; and don't underestimate your abilities." But as so often happens, the closer you get to the truth, the messier your sentence gets. We've taken a nice, neat (but wrong) slogan, and churned it up like a mud puddle. It doesn't make a very good speech anymore. But worse still, it doesn't tell you what to do anymore. Someone with your abilities? What are your abilities?
因此，我们得把《标准毕业演说》削减为：“跟你能力相同的人能做到的，你也能做到；以及不要低估你自己的能力。”然而，正如经常见到的一样：越靠近真相，句子就越拗口。我们把一条简洁、响亮（但错误）的口号，搅成了一团稀泥，再也没法放到演讲里面去了。更糟糕的是，它再也没法告诉你究竟应该干什么了。跟你能力相同的人？“你的能力”是哪些能力？

Upwind
逆风

I think the solution is to work in the other direction. Instead of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations. This is what most successful people actually do anyway.
我认为解决方案得从另一边出发。与其从目标出发向后推导，不如从当下的优势向前进发。这其实也是大部分成功人士的实际做法。

In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to be in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there? I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.
按照《标准毕业演说》的路线，你先决定你希望20年后到达哪里，然后问自己：我要怎样才能去到那儿？相反，我建议你不要纠结未来的任何目标，只看眼下的选项，并且选择那些能够在未来为你带来最优选择的。

It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you'll take.
只要你们不是在浪费时间，具体干什么并不是那么重要。多干那些令你感兴趣并且增加你的选择机会的事情，具体的选择将来再考虑。

Suppose you're a college freshman deciding whether to major in math or economics. Well, math will give you more options: you can go into almost any field from math. If you major in math it will be easy to get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economics it will be hard to get into grad school in math.
好比你是一个大一新生，正在决定是主修数学还是经济学。那么数学会给你更多机会：你可以从数学转向几乎任何专业。如果你主修数学，考经济研究生会很轻松，但如果你主修经济学，要考数学研究生就困难了。

Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn't have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule you want to stay upwind. So I propose that as a replacement for "don't give up on your dreams." Stay upwind.
这里我举一个滑翔机的例子。因为没有引擎，滑翔机在逆风飞行的过程中会损失很多高度。而如果你朝适合着陆的地点的下风向飞得太远，你拥有的选择机会就会不爽地少起来。原则上你最好保持逆风。我觉得这是“不要放弃你的梦想”的替代——保持逆风。

How do you do that, though? Even if math is upwind of economics, how are you supposed to know that as a high school student?
但，具体要怎么实施呢？即便数学是在经济学的上风向，但作为一个高中生，你怎么就会知道呢？

Well, you don't, and that's what you need to find out. Look for smart people and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you can find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it. But it's not straightforward to find these, because there is a lot of faking going on.
你确实不知道，而这就是你要搞清楚的。去寻找聪明人和困难的问题。聪明人往往抱团扎堆，如果你能找到这样的堆，加入多半是值得的。不过找的过程并不会一帆风顺，因为凡事都掺了猫腻。

To a newly arrived undergraduate, all university departments look much the same. The professors all seem forbiddingly intellectual and publish papers unintelligible to outsiders. But while in some fields the papers are unintelligible because they're full of hard ideas, in others they're deliberately written in an obscure way to seem as if they're saying something important. This may seem a scandalous proposition, but it has been experimentally verified, in the famous Social Text affair. Suspecting that the papers published by literary theorists were often just intellectual-sounding nonsense, a physicist deliberately wrote a paper full of intellectual-sounding nonsense, and submitted it to a literary theory journal, which published it.
对于一个大一新生来说，大学里所有的学院看上去都差不多。教授们看上去都学富五车，发表着外行读不懂的论文。其中一部分论文读不懂，是因为它们包含了复杂的思想；而另一部分则是故意用晦涩难懂的方法来写，让内容看上去煞有其事。这个说法听起来好像很不光彩，但它已被著名的“社科门”证实。因为怀疑文学理论家们发表的论文都只不过是听起来煞有其事的废话，一个物理学家故意写了一篇充满煞有其事的废话的论文，并投到一份文学理论期刊，结果发表成功了。

The best protection is always to be working on hard problems. Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn't. Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to be suspense.
最佳应对方案，就是坚持钻研困难的问题。写小说是很难的。读小说则不然。难表现在担忧：如果你不担心你的某个设计会失败，或者无法理解所学的内容，那就说明它不够难。一定要有悬念。

Well, this seems a grim view of the world, you may think. What I'm telling you is that you should worry? Yes, but it's not as bad as it sounds. It's exhilarating to overcome worries. You don't see faces much happier than people winning gold medals. And you know why they're so happy? Relief.
你可能会觉得这种想法很悲观。说了半天，就是让各位保持担忧？是的，但担忧其实不是坏事。克服担忧是一件令人兴奋不已的事情。没有哪种笑容比获得金牌的人更灿烂。他们这么开心是因为？解脱。

I'm not saying this is the only way to be happy. Just that some kinds of worry are not as bad as they sound.
当然，想开心有很多种方式。我只是说，某些类型的忧虑并没有听起来那么糟糕。

Ambition
野心

In practice, "stay upwind" reduces to "work on hard problems." And you can start today. I wish I'd grasped that in high school.
在实践中，“保持逆风”可以化简为“挑战难题”。你现在就可以开始挑战难题。我上高中的时候能理解这一点就好了。

Most people like to be good at what they do. In the so-called real world this need is a powerful force. But high school students rarely benefit from it, because they're given a fake thing to do. When I was in high school, I let myself believe that my job was to be a high school student. And so I let my need to be good at what I did be satisfied by merely doing well in school.
大多数人希望擅长他们所做的工作。在常说的真实社会中，这是一种重要的推动力。然而高中生很少因此受益，因为他们从事的工作都是虚构的。当年上高中的时候，我让自己相信，自己的职业就是当一名高中生。因此我所谓“擅长自己所做的工作”，只要保持成绩良好就实现了。

If you'd asked me in high school what the difference was between high school kids and adults, I'd have said it was that adults had to earn a living. Wrong. It's that adults take responsibility for themselves. Making a living is only a small part of it. Far more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.
如果你问当年的我高中生和成年人有什么区别，我可能会说成年人需要养家糊口。不对。答案是成年人需要为自己负责。养家糊口仅仅是其中一部分。远比这重要的是：为自己的智力发展负责。

If I had to go through high school again, I'd treat it like a day job. I don't mean that I'd slack in school. Working at something as a day job doesn't mean doing it badly. It means not being defined by it. I mean I wouldn't think of myself as a high school student, just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn't think of himself as a waiter. [3] And when I wasn't working at my day job I'd start trying to do real work.
如果我能再上一次高中，我会把它当成一种正职，或者叫日间工作。我的意思不是说要放松学业——把一件事当成正职不等于马虎应付——而是不要被它定义。正如一个白天端盘子的音乐人不会把自己当成一名服务员，我也不会把自己当成一个高中生。而不干正职的时候，我就会尝试去干真正的工作。

When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they nearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time. If you're wondering what you're doing now that you'll regret most later, that's probably it. [4]
当我问人们对于高中最后悔的事是什么，他们差不多都给出了一样的答案：他们浪费了太多时间。如果你想知道将来你最后悔的事情是什么，这就是答案。

Some people say this is inevitable-- that high school students aren't capable of getting anything done yet. But I don't think this is true. And the proof is that you're bored. You probably weren't bored when you were eight. When you're eight it's called "playing" instead of "hanging out," but it's the same thing. And when I was eight, I was rarely bored. Give me a back yard and a few other kids and I could play all day.
有的人说这是不可避免的——说高中阶段的学生尚不具备完成任何工作的能力。但我不同意这一点。证据就是你们很无聊。你们八岁的时候应该不会无聊。你们八岁的时候说“出去玩”，而不是“出去逛”，即便是同一件事。我八岁的时候基本不会无聊。给我一个后院加几个小朋友我可以玩一整天。

The reason this got stale in middle school and high school, I now realize, is that I was ready for something else. Childhood was getting old.
现在我才明白，初中和高中时感到无聊的，说明我已经准备好接受不一样的生活了。童年已经在逐渐远去了。

I'm not saying you shouldn't hang out with your friends-- that you should all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work. Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake. You enjoy it more if you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate cake for every meal. No matter how much you like chocolate cake, you'll be pretty queasy after the third meal of it. And that's what the malaise one feels in high school is: mental queasiness. [5]
我不是说你不应该跟朋友出去嫖——全都去做毫无幽默只知道做题的机器人。跟朋友出去嫖就像巧克力蛋糕。偶尔吃吃，比每顿都吃要更甜美。不管你有多喜欢吃巧克力蛋糕，吃到第三餐你都会反胃。而这就是人们在中学里感到不安的原因：精神反胃。

You may be thinking, we have to do more than get good grades. We have to have extracurricular activities. But you know perfectly well how bogus most of these are. Collecting donations for a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it's not hard. It's not getting something done. What I mean by getting something done is learning how to write well, or how to program computers, or what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to draw the human face from life. This sort of thing rarely translates into a line item on a college application.
你也许在想，除了看书考试我们还有好多事得做。我们还得参加课外活动。而你们也清楚地知道绝大多数课外活动有多虚伪。慈善募捐是一件值得尊敬的事情，但它难度为零。它没有收获什么成果。我所指的收获成果，是指学会比如怎样写优美的文章，或者怎样给电脑编程，或者工业革命前的社会长什么样，或者怎样给人画肖像。这类事情很少变成大学申请材料上的加分项。

Corruption
腐化

It's dangerous to design your life around getting into college, because the people you have to impress to get into college are not a very discerning audience. At most colleges, it's not the professors who decide whether you get in, but admissions officers, and they are nowhere near as smart. They're the NCOs of the intellectual world. They can't tell how smart you are. The mere existence of prep schools is proof of that.
将你的生活围绕考大学来设计是危险的，因为那些需要你为了进入大学而努力对其表演的人，并不是一群分辨能力很好的观众。在绝大多数大学里，决定你能否录取的并不是教授，而是招生办的工作人员，而后者脑子远不及前者灵光。
他们无法分辨你到底有多聪明。各种高考冲刺班的存在就是证据。

Few parents would pay so much for their kids to go to a school that didn't improve their admissions prospects. Prep schools openly say this is one of their aims. But what that means, if you stop to think about it, is that they can hack the admissions process: that they can take the very same kid and make him seem a more appealing candidate than he would if he went to the local public school. [6]
很少有家长愿意为他们的孩子支付同样多的钱，把他们送去无法增加录取概率的学校。

Right now most of you feel your job in life is to be a promising college applicant. But that means you're designing your life to satisfy a process so mindless that there's a whole industry devoted to subverting it. No wonder you become cynical. The malaise you feel is the same that a producer of reality TV shows or a tobacco industry executive feels. And you don't even get paid a lot.
此时此刻，你们中的绝大多数人都觉得你们此生的工作就是去做一个优秀的大学申请人。而这意味着，你的生活是为了去满足一个如此无意义的过程而设计的——有一整个专注于将其颠覆的产业。难怪你会变得愤世嫉俗。你感到的这种不安，和那些真人秀节目的制片人、烟草公司的经理感受到的是一样的，但你却得不到高额回报。

So what do you do? What you should not do is rebel. That's what I did, and it was a mistake. I didn't realize exactly what was happening to us, but I smelled a major rat. And so I just gave up. Obviously the world sucked, so why bother?
那你该怎么应对？你不能有叛逆心理。我当年就有，但那是错的。我那时并没有明确地认识到发生在我们身上的一切，且起了很重的疑心。于是我放弃了。世界本乏味，何须为其烦？

When I discovered that one of our teachers was herself using Cliff's Notes, it seemed par for the course. Surely it meant nothing to get a good grade in such a class.
当我发现我们的其中一位老师自己都在用cliff's notes, 我的内心毫无波澜（不出所料）。这样的课就算拿高分又有什么卵用呢？

In retrospect this was stupid. It was like someone getting fouled in a soccer game and saying, hey, you fouled me, that's against the rules, and walking off the field in indignation. Fouls happen. The thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool. Just keep playing.
事后来看这很愚蠢。这就如同在足球赛场上被人犯规，然后说，嘿，你铲到我了，这是违反规则的，然后愤慨地离场。犯规是难免的。被犯规时该做的事，是保持风范。继续比赛吧。

By putting you in this situation, society has fouled you. Yes, as you suspect, a lot of the stuff you learn in your classes is crap. And yes, as you suspect, the college admissions process is largely a charade. But like many fouls, this one was unintentional. [7] So just keep playing.
通过让你陷入这样的状况，社会对你犯规了。是的，正如你怀疑的，你在学校里学的许多东西都是垃圾。没错，正如你所怀疑的，高校招生在很大程度上是装个样子。但正如绝大多数犯规一样，它们都不是故意的。所以继续比赛吧。

Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience. In either case you let yourself be defined by what they tell you to do. The best plan, I think, is to step onto an orthogonal vector. Don't just do what they tell you, and don't just refuse to. Instead treat school as a day job. As day jobs go, it's pretty sweet. You're done at 3 o'clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you're there.
反抗几乎和服从一样愚蠢。不管哪种情况，你都是被他人对你的安排定义的。我认为，最佳方法，是站到一个垂直的矢量上去。不要把他们的安排照单全收，也不要全盘拒绝。相对的，把学校当成你的正职。正如各类正职一样，它挺清闲的。3点钟就下班了，而你甚至可以在上班时间干你自己的事情。

Curiosity
好奇心

And what's your real job supposed to be? Unless you're Mozart, your first task is to figure that out. What are the great things to work on? Where are the imaginative people? And most importantly, what are you interested in? The word "aptitude" is misleading, because it implies something innate. The most powerful sort of aptitude is a consuming interest in some question, and such interests are often acquired tastes.
那你真正的工作应该是什么呢？你的第一项任务就是搞清楚，除非你是莫扎特。可以着手的伟大的事情有哪些？富有想象力的人在哪里？以及最重要的，你感兴趣的是什么？“天赋”这个词在误导

A distorted version of this idea has filtered into popular culture under the name "passion." I recently saw an ad for waiters saying they wanted people with a "passion for service." The real thing is not something one could have for waiting on tables. And passion is a bad word for it. A better name would be curiosity.

Kids are curious, but the curiosity I mean has a different shape from kid curiosity. Kid curiosity is broad and shallow; they ask why at random about everything. In most adults this curiosity dries up entirely. It has to: you can't get anything done if you're always asking why about everything. But in ambitious adults, instead of drying up, curiosity becomes narrow and deep. The mud flat morphs into a well.

Curiosity turns work into play. For Einstein, relativity wasn't a book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam. It was a mystery he was trying to solve. So it probably felt like less work to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it in a class.

One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea that doing great things requires a lot of discipline. Most subjects are taught in such a boring way that it's only by discipline that you can flog yourself through them. So I was surprised when, early in college, I read a quote by Wittgenstein saying that he had no self-discipline and had never been able to deny himself anything, not even a cup of coffee.

Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it's the same with all of them. They have little discipline. They're all terrible procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves do anything they're not interested in. One still hasn't sent out his half of the thank-you notes from his wedding, four years ago. Another has 26,000 emails in her inbox.

I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline. You probably need about the amount you need to go running. I'm often reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it. And if I don't run for several days, I feel ill. It's the same with people who do great things. They know they'll feel bad if they don't work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary.

Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to write Great Literature? Of course not. He was having fun. That's why he's so good.

If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question. The critical moment for Einstein was when he looked at Maxwell's equations and said, what the hell is going on here?

It can take years to zero in on a productive question, because it can take years to figure out what a subject is really about. To take an extreme example, consider math. Most people think they hate math, but the boring stuff you do in school under the name "mathematics" is not at all like what mathematicians do.

The great mathematician G. H. Hardy said he didn't like math in high school either. He only took it up because he was better at it than the other students. Only later did he realize math was interesting-- only later did he start to ask questions instead of merely answering them correctly.

When a friend of mine used to grumble because he had to write a paper for school, his mother would tell him: find a way to make it interesting. That's what you need to do: find a question that makes the world interesting. People who do great things look at the same world everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that's compellingly mysterious.

And not only in intellectual matters. Henry Ford's great question was, why do cars have to be a luxury item? What would happen if you treated them as a commodity? Franz Beckenbauer's was, in effect, why does everyone have to stay in his position? Why can't defenders score goals too?

Now

If it takes years to articulate great questions, what do you do now, at sixteen? Work toward finding one. Great questions don't appear suddenly. They gradually congeal in your head. And what makes them congeal is experience. So the way to find great questions is not to search for them-- not to wander about thinking, what great discovery shall I make? You can't answer that; if you could, you'd have made it.

The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for big ideas, but to put in a lot of time on work that interests you, and in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can take roost. Einstein, Ford, and Beckenbauer all used this recipe. They all knew their work like a piano player knows the keys. So when something seemed amiss to them, they had the confidence to notice it.

Put in time how and on what? Just pick a project that seems interesting: to master some chunk of material, or to make something, or to answer some question. Choose a project that will take less than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish. Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially at first. If you're deciding between two projects, choose whichever seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another. Repeat till, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes self-sustaining, and each project generates the next one. (This could take years.)

It may be just as well not to do a project "for school," if that will restrict you or make it seem like work. Involve your friends if you want, but not too many, and only if they're not flakes. Friends offer moral support (few startups are started by one person), but secrecy also has its advantages. There's something pleasing about a secret project. And you can take more risks, because no one will know if you fail.

Don't worry if a project doesn't seem to be on the path to some goal you're supposed to have. Paths can bend a lot more than you think. So let the path grow out the project. The most important thing is to be excited about it, because it's by doing that you learn.

Don't disregard unseemly motivations. One of the most powerful is the desire to be better than other people at something. Hardy said that's what got him started, and I think the only unusual thing about him is that he admitted it. Another powerful motivator is the desire to do, or know, things you're not supposed to. Closely related is the desire to do something audacious. Sixteen year olds aren't supposed to write novels. So if you try, anything you achieve is on the plus side of the ledger; if you fail utterly, you're doing no worse than expectations. [8]

Beware of bad models. Especially when they excuse laziness. When I was in high school I used to write "existentialist" short stories like ones I'd seen by famous writers. My stories didn't have a lot of plot, but they were very deep. And they were less work to write than entertaining ones would have been. I should have known that was a danger sign. And in fact I found my stories pretty boring; what excited me was the idea of writing serious, intellectual stuff like the famous writers.

Now I have enough experience to realize that those famous writers actually sucked. Plenty of famous people do; in the short term, the quality of one's work is only a small component of fame. I should have been less worried about doing something that seemed cool, and just done something I liked. That's the actual road to coolness anyway.

A key ingredient in many projects, almost a project on its own, is to find good books. Most books are bad. Nearly all textbooks are bad. [9] So don't assume a subject is to be learned from whatever book on it happens to be closest. You have to search actively for the tiny number of good books.

The important thing is to get out there and do stuff. Instead of waiting to be taught, go out and learn.

Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers. It could be shaped by your own curiosity. It is for all ambitious adults. And you don't have to wait to start. In fact, you don't have to wait to be an adult. There's no switch inside you that magically flips when you turn a certain age or graduate from some institution. You start being an adult when you decide to take responsibility for your life. You can do that at any age. [10]

This may sound like bullshit. I'm just a minor, you may think, I have no money, I have to live at home, I have to do what adults tell me all day long. Well, most adults labor under restrictions just as cumbersome, and they manage to get things done. If you think it's restrictive being a kid, imagine having kids.

The only real difference between adults and high school kids is that adults realize they need to get things done, and high school kids don't. That realization hits most people around 23. But I'm letting you in on the secret early. So get to work. Maybe you can be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't how much time you wasted.





Notes

[1] A doctor friend warns that even this can give an inaccurate picture. "Who knew how much time it would take up, how little autonomy one would have for endless years of training, and how unbelievably annoying it is to carry a beeper?"

[2] His best bet would probably be to become dictator and intimidate the NBA into letting him play. So far the closest anyone has come is Secretary of Labor.

[3] A day job is one you take to pay the bills so you can do what you really want, like play in a band, or invent relativity.

Treating high school as a day job might actually make it easier for some students to get good grades. If you treat your classes as a game, you won't be demoralized if they seem pointless.

However bad your classes, you need to get good grades in them to get into a decent college. And that is worth doing, because universities are where a lot of the clumps of smart people are these days.

[4] The second biggest regret was caring so much about unimportant things. And especially about what other people thought of them.

I think what they really mean, in the latter case, is caring what random people thought of them. Adults care just as much what other people think, but they get to be more selective about the other people.

I have about thirty friends whose opinions I care about, and the opinion of the rest of the world barely affects me. The problem in high school is that your peers are chosen for you by accidents of age and geography, rather than by you based on respect for their judgement.

[5] The key to wasting time is distraction. Without distractions it's too obvious to your brain that you're not doing anything with it, and you start to feel uncomfortable. If you want to measure how dependent you've become on distractions, try this experiment: set aside a chunk of time on a weekend and sit alone and think. You can have a notebook to write your thoughts down in, but nothing else: no friends, TV, music, phone, IM, email, Web, games, books, newspapers, or magazines. Within an hour most people will feel a strong craving for distraction.

[6] I don't mean to imply that the only function of prep schools is to trick admissions officers. They also generally provide a better education. But try this thought experiment: suppose prep schools supplied the same superior education but had a tiny (.001) negative effect on college admissions. How many parents would still send their kids to them?

It might also be argued that kids who went to prep schools, because they've learned more, are better college candidates. But this seems empirically false. What you learn in even the best high school is rounding error compared to what you learn in college. Public school kids arrive at college with a slight disadvantage, but they start to pull ahead in the sophomore year.

(I'm not saying public school kids are smarter than preppies, just that they are within any given college. That follows necessarily if you agree prep schools improve kids' admissions prospects.)

[7] Why does society foul you? Indifference, mainly. There are simply no outside forces pushing high school to be good. The air traffic control system works because planes would crash otherwise. Businesses have to deliver because otherwise competitors would take their customers. But no planes crash if your school sucks, and it has no competitors. High school isn't evil; it's random; but random is pretty bad.

[8] And then of course there is money. It's not a big factor in high school, because you can't do much that anyone wants. But a lot of great things were created mainly to make money. Samuel Johnson said "no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money." (Many hope he was exaggerating.)

[9] Even college textbooks are bad. When you get to college, you'll find that (with a few stellar exceptions) the textbooks are not written by the leading scholars in the field they describe. Writing college textbooks is unpleasant work, done mostly by people who need the money. It's unpleasant because the publishers exert so much control, and there are few things worse than close supervision by someone who doesn't understand what you're doing. This phenomenon is apparently even worse in the production of high school textbooks.

[10] Your teachers are always telling you to behave like adults. I wonder if they'd like it if you did. You may be loud and disorganized, but you're very docile compared to adults. If you actually started acting like adults, it would be just as if a bunch of adults had been transposed into your bodies. Imagine the reaction of an FBI agent or taxi driver or reporter to being told they had to ask permission to go the bathroom, and only one person could go at a time. To say nothing of the things you're taught. If a bunch of actual adults suddenly found themselves trapped in high school, the first thing they'd do is form a union and renegotiate all the rules with the administration.

Thanks to Ingrid Bassett, Trevor Blackwell, Rich Draves, Dan Giffin, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, Mark Nitzberg, Lisa Randall, and Aaron Swartz for reading drafts of this, and to many others for talking to me about high school.
