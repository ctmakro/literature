What you'll wish you'd known
你将希望你一早知道的事儿

January 2005

(I wrote this talk for a high school. I never actually gave it, because the school authorities vetoed the plan to invite me.)

When I said I was speaking at a high school, my friends were curious. What will you say to high school students? So I asked them, what do you wish someone had told you in high school? Their answers were remarkably similar. So I'm going to tell you what we all wish someone had told us.
我的朋友们听说我要去高中演讲，都感到很好奇。跟高中生有什么好讲的？于是我问他们：假如回到高中，你最希望别人告诉你什么？结果他们的答案惊人地相似。接下来我会告诉你们，我们最希望当年有人能告诉我们的事情。

I'll start by telling you something you don't have to know in high school: what you want to do with your life. People are always asking you this, so you think you're supposed to have an answer. But adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter. They want to know what sort of person you are, and this question is just to get you talking. They ask it the way you might poke a hermit crab in a tide pool, to see what it does.
我先从高中生不需要知道的事情开始。你将来想做什么？身边的人总是问你这个问题，于是你就以为你必须得回答。其实大人问这个问题，只是想开个话茬；他们想知道你是哪种人，所以把这个问题当作话题。这种提问的方法，就如同你在草丛里敲一只蜗牛，再观察它的反应。

If I were back in high school and someone asked about my plans, I'd say that my first priority was to learn what the options were. You don't need to be in a rush to choose your life's work. What you need to do is discover what you like. You have to work on stuff you like if you want to be good at what you do.
如果回到高中，有人问我对未来的计划，我会说我的第一选择，就是搞清楚有哪些选择。你没必要这么早就决定这辈子要干什么。你倒是应该搞清楚你喜欢什么。你必须喜欢做一件事，才有可能成为做这件事的专家。

It might seem that nothing would be easier than deciding what you like, but it turns out to be hard, partly because it's hard to get an accurate picture of most jobs. Being a doctor is not the way it's portrayed on TV. Fortunately you can also watch real doctors, by volunteering in hospitals. [1]
确定自己喜欢什么，听起来是一件再简单不过的事，实际上却很困难，一部分原因是对大部分职业的准确印象很难获取。当一个真正的医生，跟电视剧里演的是两码事。不过还好，如果你想要收看真正的医生，可以去医院当志愿者。[1]

But there are other jobs you can't learn about, because no one is doing them yet. Most of the work I've done in the last ten years didn't exist when I was in high school. The world changes fast, and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up. In such a world it's not a good idea to have fixed plans.
不过，有很多工作我们是没法观看学习的，因为目前还没有人干过。过去十年里我所做的绝大多数工作，在我上高中的时候都是不存在的。世界变得很快，而变化的速度本身也在加快。在这样一个世界里，把自己的计划定的太死是不好的。

And yet every May, speakers all over the country fire up the Standard Graduation Speech, the theme of which is: don't give up on your dreams. I know what they mean, but this is a bad way to put it, because it implies you're supposed to be bound by some plan you made early on. The computer world has a name for this: premature optimization. And it is synonymous with disaster. These speakers would do better to say simply, don't give up.
然而每到五月份，全国各地的学校都会上演《标准毕业演讲》，主题是：不要放弃你的梦想。我知道他们想说什么，但这种表达有问题，因为它暗示着你要跟着你之前定好的计划去走。在计算机领域，这种做法叫做“过早优化”，它的另一个名字叫悲剧。他们如果只说“不要放弃”，其实还好一点。

What they really mean is, don't get demoralized. Don't think that you can't do what other people can. And I agree you shouldn't underestimate your potential. People who've done great things tend to seem as if they were a race apart. And most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems like the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate genius. In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.
他们真正想说的是：不要丧失斗志。别人能做到的，你不要觉得做不到。我确实也认为你们不应该低估自己的潜力。那些成就非凡的人看上去总是与众不同。而绝大多数传记都在放大这种幻觉，一方面是因为传记作者千篇一律的崇拜口吻，一方面是因为在故事结局已知的情况下，他们必须得美化剧情，直到主人公的人生看上去就像天赐的才华加命运的必然。而实际上我怀疑，如果你把16岁的莎士比亚或者爱因斯坦放到这间学校，他们或许会让你印象深刻，但不会跟你的其他朋友有太大区别。

Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our fault if we can't do something as good.
可是这话听着就不舒服了。如果他们跟我们相差无几，那他们要取得他们的成就，就必须要付出超人的努力。这就是为什么我们愿意相信“天才”的存在——它为我们提供了懒惰的借口。假如这些人的伟大成就来自于某种神奇的“爱因斯坦基因”，或者“莎士比亚基因”，那也就不能怪我们一般人做不到了。

I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius. But if you're trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.
我不是说这个世界上不存在“天才”。我是说在大多数情况下，如果一件事有两种解释，其中一种可以给你偷懒的借口，那么另一种就是对的。

So far we've cut the Standard Graduation Speech down from "don't give up on your dreams" to "what someone else can do, you can do." But it needs to be cut still further. There is some variation in natural ability. Most people overestimate its role, but it does exist. If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition was to play in the NBA, I'd feel pretty stupid saying, you can do anything if you really try. [2]
截至目前，我们已经把《标准毕业演说》从“不要放弃你的梦想”削减成了“别人能做你也能做”。但它还得再削减。每个人的天赋总是有一点差别的，虽然大部分人高估了它的影响，但它确实是存在的。假如有个一米五的人跟我说他的梦想是打NBA，那我肯定不会傻傻地跟他说，别人能做你也能做。[2]

We need to cut the Standard Graduation Speech down to, "what someone else with your abilities can do, you can do; and don't underestimate your abilities." But as so often happens, the closer you get to the truth, the messier your sentence gets. We've taken a nice, neat (but wrong) slogan, and churned it up like a mud puddle. It doesn't make a very good speech anymore. But worse still, it doesn't tell you what to do anymore. Someone with your abilities? What are your abilities?
因此，我们得把《标准毕业演说》削减为：“跟你能力相同的人能做到的，你也能做到；以及不要低估你自己的能力。”然而，正如经常见到的一样：越靠近真相，句子就越拗口。我们把一条简洁、响亮（但错误）的口号，搅成了一团稀泥，再也没法放到演讲里面去了。更糟糕的是，它再也没法告诉你究竟应该干什么了。跟你能力相同的人？“你的能力”是哪些能力？

Upwind
逆风

I think the solution is to work in the other direction. Instead of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations. This is what most successful people actually do anyway.
我认为解决方案得从另一边出发。与其从目标出发向后推导，不如从当下的优势向前进发。这其实也是大部分成功人士的实际做法。

In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to be in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there? I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.
按照《标准毕业演说》的路线，你先决定你希望20年后到达哪里，然后问自己：我要怎样才能去到那儿？相反，我建议你不要纠结未来的任何目标，只看眼下的选项，并且选择那些能够在未来为你带来最优选择的。

It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you'll take.
只要你们不是在浪费时间，具体干什么并不是那么重要。多干那些令你感兴趣并且增加你的选择机会的事情，具体的选择将来再考虑。

Suppose you're a college freshman deciding whether to major in math or economics. Well, math will give you more options: you can go into almost any field from math. If you major in math it will be easy to get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economics it will be hard to get into grad school in math.
好比你是一个大一新生，正在决定是主修数学还是经济学。那么数学会给你更多机会：你可以从数学转向几乎任何专业。如果你主修数学，考经济研究生会很轻松，但如果你主修经济学，要考数学研究生就困难了。

Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn't have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule you want to stay upwind. So I propose that as a replacement for "don't give up on your dreams." Stay upwind.
这里我举一个滑翔机的例子。因为没有引擎，滑翔机在逆风飞行的过程中会损失很多高度。而如果你朝适合着陆的地点的下风向飞得太远，你拥有的选择机会就会不爽地少起来。原则上你最好保持逆风。我觉得这是“不要放弃你的梦想”的替代——保持逆风。

How do you do that, though? Even if math is upwind of economics, how are you supposed to know that as a high school student?
但，具体要怎么实施呢？即便数学是在经济学的上风向，但作为一个高中生，你怎么就会知道呢？

Well, you don't, and that's what you need to find out. Look for smart people and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you can find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it. But it's not straightforward to find these, because there is a lot of faking going on.
你确实不知道，而这就是你要搞清楚的。去寻找聪明人和困难的问题。聪明人往往抱团扎堆，如果你能找到这样的堆，加入多半是值得的。不过找的过程并不会一帆风顺，因为凡事都掺了猫腻。

To a newly arrived undergraduate, all university departments look much the same. The professors all seem forbiddingly intellectual and publish papers unintelligible to outsiders. But while in some fields the papers are unintelligible because they're full of hard ideas, in others they're deliberately written in an obscure way to seem as if they're saying something important. This may seem a scandalous proposition, but it has been experimentally verified, in the famous Social Text affair. Suspecting that the papers published by literary theorists were often just intellectual-sounding nonsense, a physicist deliberately wrote a paper full of intellectual-sounding nonsense, and submitted it to a literary theory journal, which published it.
对于一个大一新生来说，大学里所有的学院看上去都差不多。教授们看上去都学富五车，发表着外行读不懂的论文。其中一部分论文读不懂，是因为它们包含了复杂的思想；而另一部分则是故意用晦涩难懂的方法来写，让内容看上去煞有其事。这个说法听起来好像很不光彩，但它已被著名的“社科门”证实。因为怀疑文学理论家们发表的论文都只不过是听起来煞有其事的废话，一个物理学家故意写了一篇充满煞有其事的废话的论文，并投到一份文学理论期刊，结果发表成功了。

The best protection is always to be working on hard problems. Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn't. Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to be suspense.
最佳应对方案，就是坚持钻研困难的问题。写小说是很难的。读小说则不然。难表现在担忧：如果你不担心你的某个设计会失败，或者无法理解所学的内容，那就说明它不够难。一定要有悬念。

Well, this seems a grim view of the world, you may think. What I'm telling you is that you should worry? Yes, but it's not as bad as it sounds. It's exhilarating to overcome worries. You don't see faces much happier than people winning gold medals. And you know why they're so happy? Relief.
你可能会觉得这种想法很悲观。说了半天，就是让各位保持担忧？是的，但担忧其实不是坏事。克服担忧是一件令人兴奋不已的事情。没有哪种笑容比获得金牌的人更灿烂。他们这么开心是因为？解脱。

I'm not saying this is the only way to be happy. Just that some kinds of worry are not as bad as they sound.
当然，想开心有很多种方式。我只是说，某些类型的忧虑并没有听起来那么糟糕。

Ambition
野心

In practice, "stay upwind" reduces to "work on hard problems." And you can start today. I wish I'd grasped that in high school.
在实践中，“保持逆风”可以化简为“挑战难题”。你现在就可以开始挑战难题。我上高中的时候能理解这一点就好了。

Most people like to be good at what they do. In the so-called real world this need is a powerful force. But high school students rarely benefit from it, because they're given a fake thing to do. When I was in high school, I let myself believe that my job was to be a high school student. And so I let my need to be good at what I did be satisfied by merely doing well in school.
大多数人希望擅长他们所做的工作。在常说的真实社会中，这是一种重要的推动力。然而高中生很少因此受益，因为他们从事的工作都是虚构的。当年上高中的时候，我让自己相信，自己的职业就是当一名高中生。因此我所谓“擅长自己所做的工作”，只要保持成绩良好就实现了。

If you'd asked me in high school what the difference was between high school kids and adults, I'd have said it was that adults had to earn a living. Wrong. It's that adults take responsibility for themselves. Making a living is only a small part of it. Far more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.
如果你问当年的我高中生和成年人有什么区别，我可能会说成年人需要养家糊口。不对。答案是成年人需要为自己负责。养家糊口仅仅是其中一部分。远比这重要的是：为自己的智力发展负责。

If I had to go through high school again, I'd treat it like a day job. I don't mean that I'd slack in school. Working at something as a day job doesn't mean doing it badly. It means not being defined by it. I mean I wouldn't think of myself as a high school student, just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn't think of himself as a waiter. [3] And when I wasn't working at my day job I'd start trying to do real work.
如果我能再上一次高中，我会把它当成一种正职，或者叫日间工作。我的意思不是说要放松学业——把一件事当成正职不等于马虎应付——而是不要被它定义。正如一个白天端盘子的音乐人不会把自己当成一名服务员，我也不会把自己当成一个高中生。而不干正职的时候，我就会尝试去干真正的工作。

When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they nearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time. If you're wondering what you're doing now that you'll regret most later, that's probably it. [4]
当我问人们对于高中最后悔的事是什么，他们差不多都给出了一样的答案：他们浪费了太多时间。如果你想知道将来你最后悔的事情是什么，这就是答案。

Some people say this is inevitable-- that high school students aren't capable of getting anything done yet. But I don't think this is true. And the proof is that you're bored. You probably weren't bored when you were eight. When you're eight it's called "playing" instead of "hanging out," but it's the same thing. And when I was eight, I was rarely bored. Give me a back yard and a few other kids and I could play all day.
有的人说这是不可避免的——说高中阶段的学生尚不具备完成任何工作的能力。但我不同意这一点。证据就是你们很无聊。你们八岁的时候应该不会无聊。你们八岁的时候说“出去玩”，而不是“出去逛”，即便是同一件事。我八岁的时候基本不会无聊。给我一个后院加几个小朋友我可以玩一整天。

The reason this got stale in middle school and high school, I now realize, is that I was ready for something else. Childhood was getting old.
现在我才明白，初中和高中时感到无聊的，说明我已经准备好接受不一样的生活了。童年已经在逐渐远去了。

I'm not saying you shouldn't hang out with your friends-- that you should all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work. Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake. You enjoy it more if you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate cake for every meal. No matter how much you like chocolate cake, you'll be pretty queasy after the third meal of it. And that's what the malaise one feels in high school is: mental queasiness. [5]
我不是说你不应该跟朋友出去嫖——全都去做毫无幽默只知道做题的机器人。跟朋友出去嫖就像巧克力蛋糕。偶尔吃吃，比每顿都吃要更甜美。不管你有多喜欢吃巧克力蛋糕，吃到第三餐你都会反胃。而这就是人们在中学里感到不安的原因：精神反胃。

You may be thinking, we have to do more than get good grades. We have to have extracurricular activities. But you know perfectly well how bogus most of these are. Collecting donations for a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it's not hard. It's not getting something done. What I mean by getting something done is learning how to write well, or how to program computers, or what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to draw the human face from life. This sort of thing rarely translates into a line item on a college application.
你也许在想，除了看书考试我们还有好多事得做。我们还得参加课外活动。而你们也清楚地知道绝大多数课外活动有多虚伪。慈善募捐是一件值得尊敬的事情，但它难度为零。它没有收获什么成果。我所指的收获成果，是指学会比如怎样写优美的文章，或者怎样给电脑编程，或者工业革命前的社会长什么样，或者怎样给人画肖像。这类事情很少变成大学申请材料上的加分项。

Corruption
腐化

It's dangerous to design your life around getting into college, because the people you have to impress to get into college are not a very discerning audience. At most colleges, it's not the professors who decide whether you get in, but admissions officers, and they are nowhere near as smart. They're the NCOs of the intellectual world. They can't tell how smart you are. The mere existence of prep schools is proof of that.
将你的生活围绕考大学来设计是危险的，因为那些需要你为了进入大学而努力对其表演的人，并不是一群分辨能力很好的观众。在绝大多数大学里，决定你能否录取的并不是教授，而是招生办的工作人员，而后者脑子远不及前者灵光。
他们无法分辨你到底有多聪明。各种高考冲刺班的存在就是证据。

Few parents would pay so much for their kids to go to a school that didn't improve their admissions prospects. Prep schools openly say this is one of their aims. But what that means, if you stop to think about it, is that they can hack the admissions process: that they can take the very same kid and make him seem a more appealing candidate than he would if he went to the local public school. [6]
很少有家长愿意为他们的孩子支付同样多的钱，把他们送去无法增加录取概率的学校。

Right now most of you feel your job in life is to be a promising college applicant. But that means you're designing your life to satisfy a process so mindless that there's a whole industry devoted to subverting it. No wonder you become cynical. The malaise you feel is the same that a producer of reality TV shows or a tobacco industry executive feels. And you don't even get paid a lot.
此时此刻，你们中的绝大多数人都觉得你们此生的工作就是去做一个优秀的大学申请人。而这意味着，你的生活是为了去满足一个如此无意义的过程而设计的——有一整个专注于将其颠覆的产业。难怪你会变得愤世嫉俗。你感到的这种不安，和那些真人秀节目的制片人、烟草公司的经理感受到的是一样的，但你却得不到高额回报。

So what do you do? What you should not do is rebel. That's what I did, and it was a mistake. I didn't realize exactly what was happening to us, but I smelled a major rat. And so I just gave up. Obviously the world sucked, so why bother?
那你该怎么应对？你不能有叛逆心理。我当年就有，但那是错的。我那时并没有明确地认识到发生在我们身上的一切，且起了很重的疑心。于是我放弃了。世界本乏味，何须为其烦？

When I discovered that one of our teachers was herself using Cliff's Notes, it seemed par for the course. Surely it meant nothing to get a good grade in such a class.
当我发现我们的其中一位老师自己都在用cliff's notes, 我的内心毫无波澜（不出所料）。这样的课就算拿高分又有什么卵用呢？

In retrospect this was stupid. It was like someone getting fouled in a soccer game and saying, hey, you fouled me, that's against the rules, and walking off the field in indignation. Fouls happen. The thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool. Just keep playing.
事后来看这很愚蠢。这就如同在足球赛场上被人犯规，然后说，嘿，你铲到我了，这是违反规则的，然后愤慨地离场。犯规是难免的。被犯规时该做的事，是保持风范。继续比赛吧。

By putting you in this situation, society has fouled you. Yes, as you suspect, a lot of the stuff you learn in your classes is crap. And yes, as you suspect, the college admissions process is largely a charade. But like many fouls, this one was unintentional. [7] So just keep playing.
通过让你陷入这样的状况，社会对你犯规了。是的，正如你怀疑的，你在学校里学的许多东西都是垃圾。没错，正如你所怀疑的，高校招生在很大程度上是装个样子。但正如绝大多数犯规一样，它们都不是故意的。所以继续比赛吧。

Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience. In either case you let yourself be defined by what they tell you to do. The best plan, I think, is to step onto an orthogonal vector. Don't just do what they tell you, and don't just refuse to. Instead treat school as a day job. As day jobs go, it's pretty sweet. You're done at 3 o'clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you're there.
反抗几乎和服从一样愚蠢。不管哪种情况，你都是被他人对你的安排定义的。我认为，最佳方法，是站到一个垂直的矢量上去。不要把他们的安排照单全收，也不要全盘拒绝。相对的，把学校当成你的正职。正如各类正职一样，它挺清闲的。3点钟就下班了，而你甚至可以在上班时间干你自己的事情。

Curiosity
好奇心

And what's your real job supposed to be? Unless you're Mozart, your first task is to figure that out. What are the great things to work on? Where are the imaginative people? And most importantly, what are you interested in? The word "aptitude" is misleading, because it implies something innate. The most powerful sort of aptitude is a consuming interest in some question, and such interests are often acquired tastes.
那你真正的工作应该是什么呢？你的第一项任务就是搞清楚，除非你是莫扎特。可以着手的伟大的事情有哪些？富有想象力的人在哪里？以及最重要的，你感兴趣的是什么？“天赋”这个词是误导，因为它暗示某种天生的能力。最强大的一种天赋，是【对某些问题的】consuming兴趣，而这种兴趣往往是后天形成的。

A distorted version of this idea has filtered into popular culture under the name "passion." I recently saw an ad for waiters saying they wanted people with a "passion for service." The real thing is not something one could have for waiting on tables. And passion is a bad word for it. A better name would be curiosity.
这种理念的一种误传入流行文化的版本被称为“激情”。我最近看到一个招服务员的广告，说它们需要“热爱服务行业”的人。一个人真正的热爱，不可能是为了端盘子。用“热爱”来形容不准确。用“好奇”可能更好一点。

Kids are curious, but the curiosity I mean has a different shape from kid curiosity. Kid curiosity is broad and shallow; they ask why at random about everything. In most adults this curiosity dries up entirely. It has to: you can't get anything done if you're always asking why about everything. But in ambitious adults, instead of drying up, curiosity becomes narrow and deep. The mud flat morphs into a well.
儿童都有好奇心，但我说的好奇，跟儿童的好奇是有区别的。儿童的好奇心广而浅；他们对所有的事物随机提问。对于大多数成年人，这种好奇心完全干涸了。这是必然的：如果凡事都要问个为什么，你最后什么事也做不成。但那些胸有大志的成年人，相比干涸，好奇心变得窄而深。海边的淤泥变成了一口井。

Curiosity turns work into play. For Einstein, relativity wasn't a book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam. It was a mystery he was trying to solve. So it probably felt like less work to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it in a class.
好奇心把工作变成娱乐。对爱因斯坦来说，相对论不是【一本为了考试而学的充满困难内容的书】。那是他想要解开的一个谜团。与今天在教室里学它的人相比，发明相对论对他来说可能要轻松得多。

One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea that doing great things requires a lot of discipline. Most subjects are taught in such a boring way that it's only by discipline that you can flog yourself through them. So I was surprised when, early in college, I read a quote by Wittgenstein saying that he had no self-discipline and had never been able to deny himself anything, not even a cup of coffee.
你在学校里获得的最危险的幻觉之一，就是【想要做成大事，必须非常自律】。绝大多数课程的教学，都无聊到只有靠自律才能坚持下去。所以当时刚上大学的我很惊讶，因为我读到wittgenstein的一句名言，说【他从不自律，无法拒绝自己的任何欲望，哪怕是一杯咖啡】。

Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it's the same with all of them. They have little discipline. They're all terrible procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves do anything they're not interested in. One still hasn't sent out his half of the thank-you notes from his wedding, four years ago. Another has 26,000 emails in her inbox.
如今我认识了很多做成大事的人，他们在这点上都是一样的。他们几乎没有自律。他们都是糟糕的拖延症患者，而且几乎无法完成任何他们不感兴趣的工作。比如有一个人，他自己的婚礼，他自己应该发的那部分感谢信，一直都没发，到现在已经四年了。另一个人，他的收件箱里有26,000封邮件。

I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline. You probably need about the amount you need to go running. I'm often reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it. And if I don't run for several days, I feel ill. It's the same with people who do great things. They know they'll feel bad if they don't work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary.
我可没有说你完全不需要自律。你的自律至少要能让你跑起来。我经常不是很愿意去跑步，但一旦跑起来，我还是挺享受的。如果一连几天都没跑步，我就浑身难受。那些做大事的人就是这样的。他们知道不工作就会浑身难受，而他们的自律刚好能让他们坐到桌前开始干活。然而只要干起来，兴趣就成了动力，自律就不再重要了。

Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to write Great Literature? Of course not. He was having fun. That's why he's so good.
你以为莎士比亚是通过咬紧牙关和坚持不懈才最终写出伟大的文学作品吗？不可能的。他是在享受。而这就是他为什么写得这么好。

If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question. The critical moment for Einstein was when he looked at Maxwell's equations and said, what the hell is going on here?
如果你想把一件事情做好，你需要对一个前途光明的问题保持强烈的好奇心。爱因斯坦的决定性时刻，是当他看着麦克斯韦方程说，这里究竟是怎么了？

It can take years to zero in on a productive question, because it can take years to figure out what a subject is really about. To take an extreme example, consider math. Most people think they hate math, but the boring stuff you do in school under the name "mathematics" is not at all like what mathematicians do.
要找到一个值得解决的难题，往往需要很多年，因为光搞清楚一门学科究竟是干什么的，就要花很多年。举一个极端的例子，比如数学。你们中的很多人认为自己都不喜欢数学，但你们在学校里面以“数学”的名义学的那些无聊的东西，跟数学家的工作是完全不同的。

The great mathematician G. H. Hardy said he didn't like math in high school either. He only took it up because he was better at it than the other students. Only later did he realize math was interesting-- only later did he start to ask questions instead of merely answering them correctly.
著名数学家哈迪说过，他也不喜欢高中里教的“数学”。他选择学数学，仅仅是因为他学得比其他人更好。直到后来他才发现数学其实挺有趣的——直到后来，他才开始去提出问题，而不仅仅是正确地回答问题。

When a friend of mine used to grumble because he had to write a paper for school, his mother would tell him: find a way to make it interesting. That's what you need to do: find a question that makes the world interesting. People who do great things look at the same world everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that's compellingly mysterious.
我曾经有一个朋友，当他因为要写文章交作业而抱怨的时候，他母亲就会跟他说：想办法把这件事情变得有趣。这就是你们应该做的：找到一个让世界变得有趣的问题。那些伟大的人跟其他人面对的是同一个世界，但他们能发现那些引人入胜的微妙细节。

And not only in intellectual matters. Henry Ford's great question was, why do cars have to be a luxury item? What would happen if you treated them as a commodity? Franz Beckenbauer's was, in effect, why does everyone have to stay in his position? Why can't defenders score goals too?
而且这并不局限于脑力活动。亨利·福特提出的伟大问题是，为什么汽车非得是奢侈品呢？如果把它看成日常用品会怎样？同样地，弗朗茨·贝肯鲍尔提出的是，为什么每个人都得待在自己的位置？为什么后卫就不能进球呢？

Now
现在

If it takes years to articulate great questions, what do you do now, at sixteen? Work toward finding one. Great questions don't appear suddenly. They gradually congeal in your head. And what makes them congeal is experience. So the way to find great questions is not to search for them-- not to wander about thinking, what great discovery shall I make? You can't answer that; if you could, you'd have made it.
如果明确一个伟大的问题要花很多年，那么现在，十六岁的你们要做些什么呢？为找到这个问题做准备。伟大的问题不会突然出现。它们在你的脑海中慢慢凝聚。使得它们凝聚的，是经验。因此寻找伟大问题的最佳方式，不是去寻找——不是望着天空瞎想，我应该实现什么伟大发明？你回答不了这个问题；如果能回答，那你已经实现了。

The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for big ideas, but to put in a lot of time on work that interests you, and in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can take roost. Einstein, Ford, and Beckenbauer all used this recipe. They all knew their work like a piano player knows the keys. So when something seemed amiss to them, they had the confidence to notice it.
要让一个伟大的想法在你的脑海中出现，正确方式不是去寻找伟大的想法，而是多把时间花在那些让你感兴趣的工作上，并在这个过程中保持你的心胸足够宽容，好让伟大的想法能够栖息其中。爱因斯坦、福特和贝肯鲍尔都是这么做的。他们对自己工作的熟悉，如同钢琴家对琴键的熟悉。因此当他们觉得事情不对头的时候，他们有足够的信心去关注它。

Put in time how and on what? Just pick a project that seems interesting: to master some chunk of material, or to make something, or to answer some question. Choose a project that will take less than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish. Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially at first. If you're deciding between two projects, choose whichever seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another. Repeat till, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes self-sustaining, and each project generates the next one. (This could take years.)
花时间，怎么花，花到哪？随便找一个有趣的项目：读透某一本书，或者制作点什么，或者回答点什么问题。选一个能在一个月内完成的项目，并确保你拥有完成它的能力。做一些足够难、能够锻炼你的项目，刚好即可，尤其是最初的时候。如果要在两个项目中选一个，选择哪个看上去比较好玩的。如果一个项目搞砸了，就开始另一个。重复下去直到，像一台内燃机，燃烧过程变得能够自我维持，并且一个项目产生下一个。（这个过程会花上好几年）。

It may be just as well not to do a project "for school," if that will restrict you or make it seem like work. Involve your friends if you want, but not too many, and only if they're not flakes. Friends offer moral support (few startups are started by one person), but secrecy also has its advantages. There's something pleasing about a secret project. And you can take more risks, because no one will know if you fail.
反过来，没必要做那些“为了学业”的项目，如果它会限制你，或者让它看上去像有意义的工作。可以跟你的朋友一起弄，但不要太多，而且他们不能是flakes。朋友能提供精神支持（很少有创业公司是由一个人创办的），但是保密也有它的优势。一个秘密项目有它的愉悦之处。同时你能够承担更大的风险，因为你失败之后没有人会知道。

Don't worry if a project doesn't seem to be on the path to some goal you're supposed to have. Paths can bend a lot more than you think. So let the path grow out the project. The most important thing is to be excited about it, because it's by doing that you learn.
如果一个项目看上去不像是在通往你预定的目标的路上，不要担心。路可能比你想象的更弯。所以让项目在路线上自由生长。最重要的是为之（项目）兴奋，因为动手才能让你学到东西。

Don't disregard unseemly motivations. One of the most powerful is the desire to be better than other people at something. Hardy said that's what got him started, and I think the only unusual thing about him is that he admitted it. Another powerful motivator is the desire to do, or know, things you're not supposed to. Closely related is the desire to do something audacious. Sixteen year olds aren't supposed to write novels. So if you try, anything you achieve is on the plus side of the ledger; if you fail utterly, you're doing no worse than expectations. [8]
不要忽视那些（不得体的）动机。最强大的动机之一，就是希望在某些事情上比其他人更强。哈迪曾说这是他的最初动机，而我认为他唯一与众不同的地方，就是他承认了。另一个强大动机，是去做自己不应该做、或者了解自己不了解的东西。与此紧密相关的还有对【做大胆放肆之事】的渴望。16岁不是写小说的年龄。所以如果你尝试，你取得的任何成绩都是账上的盈余；如果你完全失败，你也没有比其他人更差。

Beware of bad models. Especially when they excuse laziness. When I was in high school I used to write "existentialist" short stories like ones I'd seen by famous writers. My stories didn't have a lot of plot, but they were very deep. And they were less work to write than entertaining ones would have been. I should have known that was a danger sign. And in fact I found my stories pretty boring; what excited me was the idea of writing serious, intellectual stuff like the famous writers.
当心坏榜样。尤其当他们为懒惰找借口时。我当年在高中的时候，我曾经模仿那些著名作家，写过一些“存在主义”的短篇故事。我的故事没有多少情节，但是意味很深邃。这些故事要比那些搞笑故事容易写得多。我当时并不知道这是个危险信号。而后来我发现我那些故事其实都很无聊；是那种像著名作家一样去写严肃、富含智慧的故事的想法，在背后推动我。

Now I have enough experience to realize that those famous writers actually sucked. Plenty of famous people do; in the short term, the quality of one's work is only a small component of fame. I should have been less worried about doing something that seemed cool, and just done something I liked. That's the actual road to coolness anyway.
直到有了足够多的经验，现在的我才搞明白：这些著名作家实际上都很烂。大多数名人都很烂；短期来看，一个人作品的质量，仅仅是他名气的一小部分。当年的我真不应该去做很酷的事，而应该做我真正喜欢的事情。毕竟这才是真正通向酷炫的路。

A key ingredient in many projects, almost a project on its own, is to find good books. Most books are bad. Nearly all textbooks are bad. [9] So don't assume a subject is to be learned from whatever book on it happens to be closest. You have to search actively for the tiny number of good books.
大多数项目的一个关键组成部分——甚至本身就可以算一个项目的——是去找好书。大多数书都写得不好。几乎所有的课本都写的不好。所以不要觉得一个科目，一定要从离你最近的那本书中去学。你必须主动寻找那些为数不多的好书。

The important thing is to get out there and do stuff. Instead of waiting to be taught, go out and learn.
记住，要动起来，做实事。不要等别人来教你，要在做事的过程中学习。

Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers. It could be shaped by your own curiosity. It is for all ambitious adults. And you don't have to wait to start. In fact, you don't have to wait to be an adult. There's no switch inside you that magically flips when you turn a certain age or graduate from some institution. You start being an adult when you decide to take responsibility for your life. You can do that at any age. [10]
没必要让招生办公室将你的生活定型。你可以用你的好奇心去给它定型。所有志存高远的成年人都是这样的。而你现在就可以开始。实际上，你没必要等到成年。你的身体不会一到18岁或者大学一毕业就会发生什么神奇的变化。当你决定对你的人生负责的时候，你就开始成为成年人了。这对年龄是没有限制的。

This may sound like bullshit. I'm just a minor, you may think, I have no money, I have to live at home, I have to do what adults tell me all day long. Well, most adults labor under restrictions just as cumbersome, and they manage to get things done. If you think it's restrictive being a kid, imagine having kids.
这话听着可能比较扯淡。我是个小孩，你可能会觉得，我没有钱，只能住在家里，大人让我做什么我就得一天到晚做什么……这个，其实大多数大人都是在这样累赘般的限制下工作的，而同时还能想办法把事情做好。如果你觉得做小孩充满限制，想想带小孩吧。

The only real difference between adults and high school kids is that adults realize they need to get things done, and high school kids don't. That realization hits most people around 23. But I'm letting you in on the secret early. So get to work. Maybe you can be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't how much time you wasted.
高中生和成年人之间的唯一差别是，成年人明白他们必须把事情做好，而高中生不明白。大多数人会在23岁左右醒悟这一点。但我现在偷偷让你们提前入场。去做点实事吧！也许你们能成为，高中最后悔的事情不是浪费了多少时间，的第一代人。




Notes
脚注

[1] A doctor friend warns that even this can give an inaccurate picture. "Who knew how much time it would take up, how little autonomy one would have for endless years of training, and how unbelievably annoying it is to carry a beeper?"
一个做医生的朋友警告我，就算这样也会获得不准确的印象。“谁知道，要学多长时间，接受多少年的培训之后才能得到多么微小的一点自由，以及随身带着传呼机到底有多难以置信地烦？”

[2] His best bet would probably be to become dictator and intimidate the NBA into letting him play. So far the closest anyone has come is Secretary of Labor.
他的最佳选择可能是先成为独裁者，然后威胁NBA以允许他参赛。目前最靠近这条路线的位置是劳动部部长。

[3] A day job is one you take to pay the bills so you can do what you really want, like play in a band, or invent relativity.

Treating high school as a day job might actually make it easier for some students to get good grades. If you treat your classes as a game, you won't be demoralized if they seem pointless.

However bad your classes, you need to get good grades in them to get into a decent college. And that is worth doing, because universities are where a lot of the clumps of smart people are these days.
【正职】就是那份你用来填饱肚子的职业——然后你就可以做你真正想做的事情，比如成立乐队，或者发明相对论。
实际上，把高中当成一份日职，反而会让一部分学生更容易获得好成绩——如果你能把你的课程当成游戏一场，你就不会因为他们看上去毫无意义而灰心了。
不管你的科目有多无聊，你都必须在上面取得好成绩才能进入好的大学。而这是值得的，因为如今许多群聪明人都聚集在大学里。

[4] The second biggest regret was caring so much about unimportant things. And especially about what other people thought of them.

I think what they really mean, in the latter case, is caring what random people thought of them. Adults care just as much what other people think, but they get to be more selective about the other people.

I have about thirty friends whose opinions I care about, and the opinion of the rest of the world barely affects me. The problem in high school is that your peers are chosen for you by accidents of age and geography, rather than by you based on respect for their judgement.

第二后悔的事情，是过于关心那些并不重要的事情。尤其是关心别人对他们的看法。
我觉得他们后半句真正想说的是，过于关心一般人对他们的看法。成年人同样会关心其他人的看法，但他们知道要对“其他人”有所选择。
我身边大概三十个朋友的意见是我比较关心的，剩下整个世界对我基本没有影响。高中的问题就在于，你的同学是根据年龄和户口筛选的，而不是根据你对他们观点的尊重。

[5] The key to wasting time is distraction. Without distractions it's too obvious to your brain that you're not doing anything with it, and you start to feel uncomfortable. If you want to measure how dependent you've become on distractions, try this experiment: set aside a chunk of time on a weekend and sit alone and think. You can have a notebook to write your thoughts down in, but nothing else: no friends, TV, music, phone, IM, email, Web, games, books, newspapers, or magazines. Within an hour most people will feel a strong craving for distraction.

浪费时间的关键在于分心。没有东西让你分心的时候，你的大脑马上就能感觉到你在闲置它，而让你感到局促不安。如果你想知道有多少事情能让你分心，可以做一下这个实验：找个周末，抽一段时间用来静坐。你可以用笔记本记录你的想法，但仅此而已：没有朋友，电视，音乐，手机，微信，邮件，网页，游戏，书，报纸，或者杂志。大多数人在一个小时内就会开始对分心之物产生强烈的需求。

[6] I don't mean to imply that the only function of prep schools is to trick admissions officers. They also generally provide a better education. But try this thought experiment: suppose prep schools supplied the same superior education but had a tiny (.001) negative effect on college admissions. How many parents would still send their kids to them?

我并不是暗示说那些预科学校的唯一用途就是骗取招生办的信任。它们总的来说还是提供了更好的教育。但你可以换一个角度思考：假如预科学校提供同样好的教育，但会对大学录取产生一点微小的（0.001）负面效果。有多少家长还会把他们的小孩送过去？

It might also be argued that kids who went to prep schools, because they've learned more, are better college candidates. But this seems empirically false. What you learn in even the best high school is rounding error compared to what you learn in college. Public school kids arrive at college with a slight disadvantage, but they start to pull ahead in the sophomore year.

可能有人会说，那些预科学校的学生学得更多，所以成为了更好的招生候选人。但从经验来看不是这样的。就算读最好的高中，你能学到的东西，连大学知识的一个零头都算不上。公立学校的学生刚入学会有一点微小的差距，但从大二开始他们就领先了。

(I'm not saying public school kids are smarter than preppies, just that they are within any given college. That follows necessarily if you agree prep schools improve kids' admissions prospects.)

（我不是说公立学校的学生比预科生聪明，只是说在任何一所大学里是的。如果你认同预备学校能提升入学机会，这就不难理解了。）

[7] Why does society foul you? Indifference, mainly. There are simply no outside forces pushing high school to be good. The air traffic control system works because planes would crash otherwise. Businesses have to deliver because otherwise competitors would take their customers. But no planes crash if your school sucks, and it has no competitors. High school isn't evil; it's random; but random is pretty bad.

为什么社会要对你犯规？主要是因为无所谓。根本没有任何外部动力去推动学校进步。空中交通管制系统要正常工作，因为不正常就会死人。各行各业必须按时交付，不然竞争者就会带走客户。但你的学校不管多烂，都不会死人，也没有竞争者。高中并不是恶意迫害；它只是一切随缘；但一切随缘其实很不好。

[8] And then of course there is money. It's not a big factor in high school, because you can't do much that anyone wants. But a lot of great things were created mainly to make money. Samuel Johnson said "no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money." (Many hope he was exaggerating.)
还有一个就是钱。这在高中不是主要因素，因为你cant't do much that anyone wants.（译者注：这段实在是翻译不了。）但很多伟大的作品都是以赚钱为主要目的而创作的。用萨缪尔·约翰逊的话说，“不以赚钱为目的的写作都是神经病”（很多人宁愿相信他是在夸张）。

[9] Even college textbooks are bad. When you get to college, you'll find that (with a few stellar exceptions) the textbooks are not written by the leading scholars in the field they describe. Writing college textbooks is unpleasant work, done mostly by people who need the money. It's unpleasant because the publishers exert so much control, and there are few things worse than close supervision by someone who doesn't understand what you're doing. This phenomenon is apparently even worse in the production of high school textbooks.
大学的教材也很糟糕。当你进到大学的时候，你会发现教科书（个别神作除外）并不是由具体领域内的顶尖学者撰写的。写大学教材是很不爽的工作，通常是由那些需要钱的人写的。不爽是因为出版社施加太多控制，没有什么能比让一帮不明白你在干嘛的人来监督你更糟糕了。这个现象在高中教材的制作过程中更突出。

[10] Your teachers are always telling you to behave like adults. I wonder if they'd like it if you did. You may be loud and disorganized, but you're very docile compared to adults. If you actually started acting like adults, it would be just as if a bunch of adults had been transposed into your bodies. Imagine the reaction of an FBI agent or taxi driver or reporter to being told they had to ask permission to go the bathroom, and only one person could go at a time. To say nothing of the things you're taught. If a bunch of actual adults suddenly found themselves trapped in high school, the first thing they'd do is form a union and renegotiate all the rules with the administration.

你们的老师总是跟你们说要表现得像个大人。我不觉得他们真的希望你照做。也许你很吵很闹，但实际上你比大人乖多了。如果你们真的开始表现得像大人，那就大概跟一群大人被转换到你们的身体里差不多。想象一下一位民警、的士司机或者记者会有什么反应，当他们听说上厕所前必须打报告，而且一次只能去一个人。对教学内容不能发表任何意见。如果一群大人突然发现自己被困在高中里，他们第一件事就是组织工会，然后跟校方重新协商所有规定。

Thanks to Ingrid Bassett, Trevor Blackwell, Rich Draves, Dan Giffin, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, Mark Nitzberg, Lisa Randall, and Aaron Swartz for reading drafts of this, and to many others for talking to me about high school.
