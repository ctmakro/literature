二零零五年一月

(I wrote this talk for a high school. I never actually gave it, because the school authorities vetoed the plan to invite me.)

（这篇讲稿原本是写给一间高中的。然而一直都没有发表，因为校方取消了对我的邀请。）

When I said I was speaking at a high school, my friends were curious. What will you say to high school students? So I asked them, what do you wish someone had told you in high school? Their answers were remarkably similar. So I'm going to tell you what we all wish someone had told us.

我的朋友听说我要去高中演讲，都过来问我，你准备跟高中生讲什么呀？于是我就问他们：有哪些事情你希望在上高中的时候就有人告诉你？他们的回答惊人地相似。接下来我就告诉你们，我们最希望当年有人能告诉我们的事情。

I'll start by telling you something you don't have to know in high school: what you want to do with your life. People are always asking you this, so you think you're supposed to have an answer. But adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter. They want to know what sort of person you are, and this question is just to get you talking. They ask it the way you might poke a hermit crab in a tide pool, to see what it does.

我先跟你们讲一些高中生不需要知道的事情。你将来想干什么？可能经常有人问你这个问题，于是你就以为必须要有答案。其实大人问这种问题，只是想跟你搭上话。他们想了解你这个人怎么样，所以用这种方式来引出话题。他们的这种提问方式，就跟你在海边戳一只螃蟹，来观察它的反应是一样的。

If I were back in high school and someone asked about my plans, I'd say that my first priority was to learn what the options were. You don't need to be in a rush to choose your life's work. What you need to do is discover what you like. You have to work on stuff you like if you want to be good at what you do.

如果我穿越回高中，别人问我对未来的计划，我会说我的第一选择，就是先搞清楚有哪些选择。你们不用急着决定这辈子做什么，你们应该搞清楚的，是你们喜欢什么。你必须喜欢做一件事，才有可能成为做这件事的专家。

It might seem that nothing would be easier than deciding what you like, but it turns out to be hard, partly because it's hard to get an accurate picture of most jobs. Being a doctor is not the way it's portrayed on TV. Fortunately you can also watch real doctors, by volunteering in hospitals. [1]

确定自己喜欢什么，听起来是一件很简单的事情，实际上却相当困难，一部分是因为大多数职业给我们留下的印象不准确。比如说当医生，跟我们在电视剧里面看到的医生完全是两码事。不过还好，如果你们想接触真正的医生，可以去医院当志愿者。[1]

But there are other jobs you can't learn about, because no one is doing them yet. Most of the work I've done in the last ten years didn't exist when I was in high school. The world changes fast, and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up. In such a world it's not a good idea to have fixed plans.

然而还有很多工作，你们没办法像这样去了解，因为这些工作还没有人干过。过去十年里我所从事的绝大多数工作，在我上高中的时候都是不存在的。世界变化得很快，变化的速度本身也在加快。在这样的世界里把自己的计划定的太死是不好的。

And yet every May, speakers all over the country fire up the Standard Graduation Speech, the theme of which is: don't give up on your dreams. I know what they mean, but this is a bad way to put it, because it implies you're supposed to be bound by some plan you made early on. The computer world has a name for this: premature optimization. And it is synonymous with disaster. These speakers would do better to say simply, don't give up.

话虽这么说，每到五月全国各地都会上演《标准毕业演讲》，演讲的主题是：“不要放弃你们的梦想”。他们的想法我能理解，但这种表达方式不好，因为它暗示着你们应该坚持你们很早之前定下的计划。这在计算机圈子里专门有一个词，叫“提前优化”。意思跟灾难差不多。这些演讲的人如果只说“不要放弃”，可能还好一点。

What they really mean is, don't get demoralized. Don't think that you can't do what other people can. And I agree you shouldn't underestimate your potential. People who've done great things tend to seem as if they were a race apart. And most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems like the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate genius. In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.

他们真正想表达的是：不要丧失斗志。别人能做到的，你们不要怕做不到。我也确实认为，你们不应该低估自己的潜力。那些成就非凡的人看上去总是与众不同，而绝大多数的人物传记都在放大这种幻觉，一方面是因为传记作者改不掉的崇拜口吻，一方面是因为在故事结局已定的情况下，他们忍不住要提炼剧情，直到主人公的人生看上去就像命运的必然，天赋异禀、灵光一现。其实我相信，如果16岁的莎士比亚或者爱因斯坦跟你们一起上学，他们的表现可能很出色，但不至于跟你们有什么特殊的区别。

Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our fault if we can't do something as good.

这个想法让人觉得很不舒服。假如他们跟我们没什么区别，那他们要取得他们的成就，岂不就要付出超人的努力？而这就是我们宁可相信天才的原因之一。它为我们的懒惰提供了一个借口。假如这些人的伟大成就，仅仅是因为某种神奇的“爱因斯坦基因”，或者“莎士比亚基因”，那我们做不到，也就不是我们自身的问题了。

I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius. But if you're trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.

我不是说这个世界上就不存在天才。但如果你要在两套理论中进行选择，其中一套给你提供偷懒的借口，那么另一套通常就是对的。

So far we've cut the Standard Graduation Speech down from "don't give up on your dreams" to "what someone else can do, you can do." But it needs to be cut still further. There is some variation in natural ability. Most people overestimate its role, but it does exist. If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition was to play in the NBA, I'd feel pretty stupid saying, you can do anything if you really try. [2]

目前为止，我们已经把《标准毕业演讲》从“不要放弃你们的梦想”，缩短到了“别人行，你就行”。但它还可以再简洁一点。每个人的自然能力是有一点区别的，虽然大部分人高估了它的影响，但它仍然是存在的。假如一个一米五的人告诉我他的梦想是加入NBA，跟他说“功夫不负有心人”只会让我觉得自己很傻逼。[2]

We need to cut the Standard Graduation Speech down to, "what someone else with your abilities can do, you can do; and don't underestimate your abilities." But as so often happens, the closer you get to the truth, the messier your sentence gets. We've taken a nice, neat (but wrong) slogan, and churned it up like a mud puddle. It doesn't make a very good speech anymore. But worse still, it doesn't tell you what to do anymore. Someone with your abilities? What are your abilities?

所以我们得把《标准毕业演讲》缩短成：“跟你能力相同的人行，你就行；同时不要低估自己的能力。”唉，很多时候都是这样，越接近事实真相，描述就越复杂。最后我们把一条简洁、响亮（但有错）的口号，搅成了一坨泥巴，再也没法把演讲带入高潮了。最关键的是，它再也不能指导你的行动了。跟你们能力相同的人？你们的“能力”都有哪些？

Upwind

上风

I think the solution is to work in the other direction. Instead of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations. This is what most successful people actually do anyway.

我认为解决方案是换一个方向思考。不要从最终目标倒推，而是朝优势方向前进。反正这也是大部分成功人士的实际做法。

In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to be in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there? I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.

如果按照毕业演讲的那种说法，你先决定你20年后想去哪里，然后问自己：我要怎样才能去到那个地方？恰恰相反，我建议你不要考虑任何长远目标，只看眼前的选项，并选择可以给未来的你提供最丰富选项的那些选项。

It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you'll take.

只要不是在浪费时间，具体干什么并不重要。多做那些让你感兴趣的、丰富你的选择余地的事情，至于具体选择将来再考虑。

Suppose you're a college freshman deciding whether to major in math or economics. Well, math will give you more options: you can go into almost any field from math. If you major in math it will be easy to get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economics it will be hard to get into grad school in math.

假如你是一个大一新生，正在犹豫选数学还是选经济学。应该说，数学会给你更多机会：你可以从数学转几乎任何专业。如果你学的是数学，考经济研究生会很轻松，如果你学的是经济，要考数学研究生就比较困难了。

Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn't have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule you want to stay upwind. So I propose that as a replacement for "don't give up on your dreams." Stay upwind.

这可以用开滑翔机来比喻。滑翔机因为没有引擎，在逆风飞行的过程中会不断损失高度。如果你飞到那些最佳的降落地点的下风位置，你的可选降落地点就会非常少。通常来说你们要尽量占上风。因此我建议用这个口号代替“不要放弃你的梦想”：要占上风。

How do you do that, though? Even if math is upwind of economics, how are you supposed to know that as a high school student?

那好，具体要怎样占上风？就算数学占经济学的上风，但作为一名高中生，你怎么可能知道这些呢？

Well, you don't, and that's what you need to find out. Look for smart people and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you can find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it. But it's not straightforward to find these, because there is a lot of faking going on.

确实不可能，所以你就应该想办法去了解。时刻留意困难的问题和聪明的人。聪明人都是扎堆出现的，如果你能找到这样的堆，不妨扎进去看看。但想找到这样的堆，却并没有那么容易，因为现在造假太猖獗了。

To a newly arrived undergraduate, all university departments look much the same. The professors all seem forbiddingly intellectual and publish papers unintelligible to outsiders. But while in some fields the papers are unintelligible because they're full of hard ideas, in others they're deliberately written in an obscure way to seem as if they're saying something important. This may seem a scandalous proposition, but it has been experimentally verified, in the famous Social Text affair. Suspecting that the papers published by literary theorists were often just intellectual-sounding nonsense, a physicist deliberately wrote a paper full of intellectual-sounding nonsense, and submitted it to a literary theory journal, which published it.

在刚入学的新生看来，大学里面所有的学院都差不多。教授们看上去个个都睿智无比，发表着外行看不懂的论文。问题是，一部分专业的论文让人看不懂是因为它们确实包含了高深的理论，但也有一部分专业的论文是故意写得让人看不懂，好假装他们在讨论很重要的问题。

这听起来有点像阴谋论，然而著名的《社会文本》事件（“索卡事件”）早已证实了这一点。当时一名物理学家（索卡，Sokal）怀疑文学批评领域的论文大多数都是在故作深沉地胡扯，于是故意写了一篇从头到尾都在故作深沉胡扯的论文，然后投给一份文学理论期刊（即《社会文本》, Social Text），结果成功发表。

The best protection is always to be working on hard problems. Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn't. Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to be suspense.

最佳的防御手段就是坚持挑战难题。比如写小说是很难的，读小说则不是。难表现为担忧：如果你不担心你正在做的某个东西会失败，或者正在学的某些知识学不会，那就说明它不够难。过程必须要有悬念。

Well, this seems a grim view of the world, you may think. What I'm telling you is that you should worry? Yes, but it's not as bad as it sounds. It's exhilarating to overcome worries. You don't see faces much happier than people winning gold medals. And you know why they're so happy? Relief.

你也许会觉得这是一种悲观的看法。讲来讲去，就是让大家提心吊胆？没错，但担忧并不是坏事，战胜担忧则更是一件令人兴奋的事情。有哪种笑容比获得金牌的笑容更灿烂？他们为什么这么开心？因为庆幸。

I'm not saying this is the only way to be happy. Just that some kinds of worry are not as bad as they sound.

当然这不是开心的唯一方法。我只是想告诉你们，某些类型的担忧其实不是坏事。

Ambition

野心

In practice, "stay upwind" reduces to "work on hard problems." And you can start today. I wish I'd grasped that in high school.

结合实际，我们把“要占上风”简化为“挑战难题”。你们现在就可以开始挑战难题。我上高中的时候要是能理解这一点就好了。

Most people like to be good at what they do. In the so-called real world this need is a powerful force. But high school students rarely benefit from it, because they're given a fake thing to do. When I was in high school, I let myself believe that my job was to be a high school student. And so I let my need to be good at what I did be satisfied by merely doing well in school.

绝大多数人都希望擅长自己所做的工作，这种追求在现实世界中是一种强大的动力。但这种动力对高中生没用，因为高中生的工作内容都是虚构的。我当年上高中的时候就一直跟自己说，我的本职工作就是当一名高中生，因此我对“擅长自己所做的工作”的追求，仅仅是保持成绩良好而已。

If you'd asked me in high school what the difference was between high school kids and adults, I'd have said it was that adults had to earn a living. Wrong. It's that adults take responsibility for themselves. Making a living is only a small part of it. Far more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.

如果回到当年，你问我高中生和成年人的区别是什么，我会说成年人需要养家糊口。错。成年人需要为自己负责，而养家糊口仅仅是负责的一小部分。为自己担负起知识责任，比养家糊口重要得多。

If I had to go through high school again, I'd treat it like a day job. I don't mean that I'd slack in school. Working at something as a day job doesn't mean doing it badly. It means not being defined by it. I mean I wouldn't think of myself as a high school student, just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn't think of himself as a waiter. [3] And when I wasn't working at my day job I'd start trying to do real work.

如果我可以再读一次高中，我会把它当成一种正职（或者叫本职工作、份内工作）。正职不等于放松学业，把一件事当成正职，并不等于马虎应付。关键是不要让它定义你，意思就是说，我不会把自己当成一名高中生；就像一个白天在饭店端盘子的音乐家，不会把自己当成一名服务员。而只要不干正职，我就会去干我真正的工作。

When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they nearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time. If you're wondering what you're doing now that you'll regret most later, that's probably it. [4]

当我问其他人对于高中最后悔是什么，他们几乎都给出了一样的答案：浪费了太多时间。如果你想知道将来你最后悔的事情是什么，答案估计就是这个。

Some people say this is inevitable-- that high school students aren't capable of getting anything done yet. But I don't think this is true. And the proof is that you're bored. You probably weren't bored when you were eight. When you're eight it's called "playing" instead of "hanging out," but it's the same thing. And when I was eight, I was rarely bored. Give me a back yard and a few other kids and I could play all day.

有人说这是难免的——毕竟高中阶段的学生尚不具备从事任何真正工作的能力。但我觉得这是错的，证据就是各位每天都很无聊。你们上小学的时候是不会无聊的。你们上小学的时候会说“出去玩”而不会说“出去嗨”虽然说的是同一件事。我上小学的时候绝对不会无聊。给我一个院子加几个小朋友，我可以玩一整天。

The reason this got stale in middle school and high school, I now realize, is that I was ready for something else. Childhood was getting old.

现在我才搞明白：同样是玩，初中和高中的我觉得无聊，是因为那时的我已经准备好做别的事情了。我的童年正在逐渐远去。

I'm not saying you shouldn't hang out with your friends-- that you should all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work. Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake. You enjoy it more if you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate cake for every meal. No matter how much you like chocolate cake, you'll be pretty queasy after the third meal of it. And that's what the malaise one feels in high school is: mental queasiness. [5]

我不是说你们不能跟朋友出去玩——全都把自己变成毫无幽默只会做题的机器人。我觉得跟朋友出去玩就像巧克力蛋糕，可以偶尔吃吃，但不能当饭吃。不管你有多喜欢巧克力蛋糕，吃到第三餐都会吐的。而这就是你们在中学感受到的那种奇怪感觉的本质：精神反胃。

You may be thinking, we have to do more than get good grades. We have to have extracurricular activities. But you know perfectly well how bogus most of these are. Collecting donations for a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it's not hard. It's not getting something done. What I mean by getting something done is learning how to write well, or how to program computers, or what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to draw the human face from life. This sort of thing rarely translates into a line item on a college application.

你们可能会觉得，除了看书考试你们还有好多事要做。你们还有课外活动。但你们其实也知道这些所谓的活动有多假。慈善募捐是一件值得尊敬的事情，但它没有难度，你也收获不到什么成果。我所谓的收获成果，是指学习比如怎样写优美的文章，或者怎样给电脑编程，或者研究工业革命前的社会是什么样子，或者怎样给人画肖像。这类活动一般不会为你的大学申请材料加分。

Corruption

腐化

It's dangerous to design your life around getting into college, because the people you have to impress to get into college are not a very discerning audience. At most colleges, it's not the professors who decide whether you get in, but admissions officers, and they are nowhere near as smart. They're the NCOs of the intellectual world. They can't tell how smart you are. The mere existence of prep schools is proof of that.

围绕大学录取来安排你的人生是有风险的，因为那些通过欣赏你的表演来决定是否录取你的人，眼光其实都一般般。在绝大多数大学，决定是否录取你的人并不是教授，而是招生办的工作人员，而后者远没有前者聪明。他们是知识界的NCO（译者注：士官，字面为“非委任军官”）。他们分辨不出你究竟有多聪明。各种预科学校的存在就是最好的证据。

Few parents would pay so much for their kids to go to a school that didn't improve their admissions prospects. Prep schools openly say this is one of their aims. But what that means, if you stop to think about it, is that they can hack the admissions process: that they can take the very same kid and make him seem a more appealing candidate than he would if he went to the local public school. [6]

如果不是因为能提高录取概率，很少有家长愿意把小孩送到那么贵的学校。预科学校也公开承认这是他们的目标之一。但如果你仔细想一下，这意味着他们可以破解招生流程：相比公立学校，他们可以把同样一个孩子打造成更优秀的申请人。

Right now most of you feel your job in life is to be a promising college applicant. But that means you're designing your life to satisfy a process so mindless that there's a whole industry devoted to subverting it. No wonder you become cynical. The malaise you feel is the same that a producer of reality TV shows or a tobacco industry executive feels. And you don't even get paid a lot.

如今在座的大多数人都认为自己的目标是成为一个优秀的大学申请人。而这就等于说，你集中全部力量去通过这样一个愚蠢的流程，而这个流程有一整个产业专门破解它。所以你们变成愤青是正常的。这种难以形容的感觉，跟那些真人秀制片人、烟草公司老板的内心感受是一样的。关键你赚的还没有他们多啊！

So what do you do? What you should not do is rebel. That's what I did, and it was a mistake. I didn't realize exactly what was happening to us, but I smelled a major rat. And so I just gave up. Obviously the world sucked, so why bother?

那你该怎么办？首先你不能叛逆。我当年就试过，事实证明我错了。我当年并没有意识到我们正在经历一个怎样的过程，然而严重怀疑它存在的意义。于是我自暴自弃。人生如此灰暗，何苦自寻烦恼？

When I discovered that one of our teachers was herself using Cliff's Notes, it seemed par for the course. Surely it meant nothing to get a good grade in such a class.

事实也不出所料，我发现有一位老师连她自己都在用cliff's notes。这样的课就算拿高分又有什么卵用呢？

In retrospect this was stupid. It was like someone getting fouled in a soccer game and saying, hey, you fouled me, that's against the rules, and walking off the field in indignation. Fouls happen. The thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool. Just keep playing.

事后想想这样搞很愚蠢。这就像踢球的时候被人犯规，然后说：喂，你铲到我了，这是犯规的，然后愤怒地离场。球场上的犯规是难免的。被犯规之后的正确做法，是保持风范，继续比赛。

By putting you in this situation, society has fouled you. Yes, as you suspect, a lot of the stuff you learn in your classes is crap. And yes, as you suspect, the college admissions process is largely a charade. But like many fouls, this one was unintentional. [7] So just keep playing.

社会这样对待你们，其实就是在对你们犯规。对，没错，高中学的大部分内容都是垃圾。对，没错，大学入学基本上就是走过场。然而很多犯规并不是故意的，所以继续比赛吧。

Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience. In either case you let yourself be defined by what they tell you to do. The best plan, I think, is to step onto an orthogonal vector. Don't just do what they tell you, and don't just refuse to. Instead treat school as a day job. As day jobs go, it's pretty sweet. You're done at 3 o'clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you're there.

不管是叛逆还是屈服，你都是在用别人的要求定义自己，都是很蠢的做法。我认为最佳方案是取一个垂直矢量：既不要照单全收，也不要全盘拒绝，而把学校当成你的正职。作为一份正职，这已经算相当不错了。每天3点就可以下班，而且连上班时间都可以干自己的事情。

Curiosity

好奇心

And what's your real job supposed to be? Unless you're Mozart, your first task is to figure that out. What are the great things to work on? Where are the imaginative people? And most importantly, what are you interested in? The word "aptitude" is misleading, because it implies something innate. The most powerful sort of aptitude is a consuming interest in some question, and such interests are often acquired tastes.

那你真正的工作应该是什么呢？既然你不是莫扎特，就应该先去搞清楚。有哪些问题非常值得解决？在哪里能找到富有想象力的人？以及最重要的，你对什么感兴趣？“天赋”这个词对人是一种误导，因为它暗示你有些能力是天生的。最强大的天赋，就是对钻研某些问题具有强烈兴趣，而这种兴趣往往是后天形成的。

A distorted version of this idea has filtered into popular culture under the name "passion." I recently saw an ad for waiters saying they wanted people with a "passion for service." The real thing is not something one could have for waiting on tables. And passion is a bad word for it. A better name would be curiosity.

不过在流行文化中，这种说法被人扭曲成了所谓的“激情”。我最近看到一个广告招服务员，上面说需要“热爱服务行业，有工作激情”的人。端盘子不是一件值得热爱的事情，用“激情”来形容就更不对了。用“好奇”还差不多。

Kids are curious, but the curiosity I mean has a different shape from kid curiosity. Kid curiosity is broad and shallow; they ask why at random about everything. In most adults this curiosity dries up entirely. It has to: you can't get anything done if you're always asking why about everything. But in ambitious adults, instead of drying up, curiosity becomes narrow and deep. The mud flat morphs into a well.

小朋友都有好奇心，但我说的好奇，跟小朋友的好奇是有区别的。小朋友的好奇心广而浅；他们会对一切事物随机提问。大多数成年人的这种好奇心完全干涸了。这是必然的，如果一个人凡事都要问个为什么，那他最后什么事也做不成。但那些胸有大志的成年人，他们的好奇心不会干涸，而是变得窄而深，从一滩淤泥变成了一口深井。

Curiosity turns work into play. For Einstein, relativity wasn't a book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam. It was a mystery he was trying to solve. So it probably felt like less work to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it in a class.

好奇心可以把工作变成娱乐。对爱因斯坦来说，相对论并不是【一本为了考试而学的充满困难内容的书】，而是他想要解开的一个谜团。他当年发明相对论，估计比今天很多人在课堂上学习相对论还要轻松得多。

One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea that doing great things requires a lot of discipline. Most subjects are taught in such a boring way that it's only by discipline that you can flog yourself through them. So I was surprised when, early in college, I read a quote by Wittgenstein saying that he had no self-discipline and had never been able to deny himself anything, not even a cup of coffee.

学校传递给你的最危险的错觉之一，就是【想要成功，必先自宫】。绝大多数课程的教学方式都无聊到只有靠自律才能坚持下去。所以我刚上大学的时候，读到维特根斯坦(译者注：著名哲学家)的一句话感到非常吃惊，他说他从来不自律，从不拒绝自己的任何欲望，哪怕是一杯咖啡。

Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it's the same with all of them. They have little discipline. They're all terrible procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves do anything they're not interested in. One still hasn't sent out his half of the thank-you notes from his wedding, four years ago. Another has 26,000 emails in her inbox.

如今我认识了很多做成大事的人，他们也都有一模一样的问题。他们根本就没有自律。他们全都是拖延症晚期患者，而且几乎不会去做任何他们不感兴趣的工作。比如有一个人，他自己的婚礼，他应该发的那部分感谢信，到现在已经四年了都没发。还有一个人，她收件箱里有26,000封未读邮件。

I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline. You probably need about the amount you need to go running. I'm often reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it. And if I don't run for several days, I feel ill. It's the same with people who do great things. They know they'll feel bad if they don't work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary.

我不是说你就完全不需要自律，你的自律至少要能让你坚持跑步。我经常一听到跑步就不想动，但只要一跑起来我就会开始享受它，如果一连好几天都没跑步我就浑身难受。那些做大事的人就是这样的。他们一不工作就浑身难受，而他们的自律刚好能让他们坐到桌前开始干活。然而只要干起来，兴趣就成了动力，而不需要再靠自律了。

Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to write Great Literature? Of course not. He was having fun. That's why he's so good.

你以为莎士比亚是通过咬紧牙关和坚持不懈才最终写出伟大的文学作品吗？当然不是。他是在享受过程。而这就是为什么他写得这么好。

If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question. The critical moment for Einstein was when he looked at Maxwell's equations and said, what the hell is going on here?

如果你想把一件事情做好，你需要对一个充满期待的问题保持强烈的好奇心。爱因斯坦的决定性时刻，就是当他看着麦克斯韦方程，说，这里究竟缺了什么？

It can take years to zero in on a productive question, because it can take years to figure out what a subject is really about. To take an extreme example, consider math. Most people think they hate math, but the boring stuff you do in school under the name "mathematics" is not at all like what mathematicians do.

要找到一个值得解决的难题，往往需要很多年，因为光搞清楚一门学科究竟是研究什么的，就要花很多年。一个极端的例子就是数学。你们中的很多人认为自己都不喜欢数学，然而你们在学校里面以“数学”的名义学的那些无聊的东西，其实跟数学家的工作是完全不同的。

The great mathematician G. H. Hardy said he didn't like math in high school either. He only took it up because he was better at it than the other students. Only later did he realize math was interesting-- only later did he start to ask questions instead of merely answering them correctly.

著名数学家哈迪说过，他上高中的时候也不喜欢数学。他选择数学，仅仅是因为他学得比其他人更好。直到后来他才发现数学其实挺有趣的——因为直到后来，他才开始去提出问题，而不仅仅是正确地回答问题。

When a friend of mine used to grumble because he had to write a paper for school, his mother would tell him: find a way to make it interesting. That's what you need to do: find a question that makes the world interesting. People who do great things look at the same world everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that's compellingly mysterious.

我有一个朋友，当年他一边写课程报告一边发牢骚的时候，他母亲会跟他说：想办法让这份作业有趣一点。这就是你们要做的：找一个让世界有趣一点的问题。那些成就大事的人，面对的是跟普通人一样的世界，但他们注意到了那些引人入胜的微妙细节。

And not only in intellectual matters. Henry Ford's great question was, why do cars have to be a luxury item? What would happen if you treated them as a commodity? Franz Beckenbauer's was, in effect, why does everyone have to stay in his position? Why can't defenders score goals too?

并不是只有学术领域才能这样。亨利·福特提出的伟大问题是，为什么汽车非得是奢侈品呢？如果你把它们当成日常用品会怎样？同样地，弗朗茨·贝肯鲍尔提出的是，为什么每个人都得守在自己的位置？为什么后卫就不能进球呢？

Now
那么

If it takes years to articulate great questions, what do you do now, at sixteen? Work toward finding one. Great questions don't appear suddenly. They gradually congeal in your head. And what makes them congeal is experience. So the way to find great questions is not to search for them-- not to wander about thinking, what great discovery shall I make? You can't answer that; if you could, you'd have made it.

如果明确一个伟大的问题要花很多年，那么现在，十六岁的你们可以做些什么呢？开始找吧。伟大的问题是不会突然出现的，而是在你的脑海中逐渐凝聚。促使它们凝聚的，是经验。因此寻找伟大问题的最佳方式，不是去寻找——不是望着天空瞎想，我应该实现什么伟大发明？你回答不了这个问题；如果你能，那你已经实现了。

The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for big ideas, but to put in a lot of time on work that interests you, and in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can take roost. Einstein, Ford, and Beckenbauer all used this recipe. They all knew their work like a piano player knows the keys. So when something seemed amiss to them, they had the confidence to notice it.

要让一个伟大的想法在你的脑海中出现，正确方式不是去寻找伟大的想法，而是多花时间在那些让你感兴趣的工作上，并在这个过程中保持你的心胸足够宽容，好让伟大的想法能够栖息其中。爱因斯坦、福特和贝肯鲍尔都是这么做的。他们像钢琴家熟悉琴键一样熟悉自己的工作。因此当他们感觉事有蹊跷的时候，他们可以相信自己的直觉。

Put in time how and on what? Just pick a project that seems interesting: to master some chunk of material, or to make something, or to answer some question. Choose a project that will take less than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish. Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially at first. If you're deciding between two projects, choose whichever seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another. Repeat till, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes self-sustaining, and each project generates the next one. (This could take years.)

花时间，怎么花，花到哪？随便找一个有趣的项目：读透某一本书，或者制作点什么，或者回答点什么问题。选一个能在一个月内完成的项目，并确保你拥有完成它的能力。做一些足够难、能够锻炼你的项目，但不要太难，尤其是刚开始的时候。如果要在两个项目中选一个，选那个看上去比较好玩的。如果一个项目做砸了，就去做另一个。这样重复下去，直到你变成一台能保持运转的发动机，让每一个项目催生下一个。（这过程要花上好几年。）

It may be just as well not to do a project "for school," if that will restrict you or make it seem like work. Involve your friends if you want, but not too many, and only if they're not flakes. Friends offer moral support (few startups are started by one person), but secrecy also has its advantages. There's something pleasing about a secret project. And you can take more risks, because no one will know if you fail.

换句话讲：不要“为了成绩”去做项目，假如那样会限制你，或者让你觉得像在干正事。可以叫上朋友一起弄，但别叫太多，尤其不能叫那些凑热闹的。朋友可以提供精神支持（很少有创业公司是一个人创办的），不过自己偷偷搞也没问题，一个秘密计划自有它值得享受之处。而且你可以冒更大的险，因为就算失败也没人知道。

Don't worry if a project doesn't seem to be on the path to some goal you're supposed to have. Paths can bend a lot more than you think. So let the path grow out the project. The most important thing is to be excited about it, because it's by doing that you learn.

如果一个项目看上去离你的某个预定目标越来越远，先别急。路，有时就是比你想的要弯。不如就让项目沿着路自然生长吧。最重要的是享受这个过程，因为你是通过做的过程来学习的。

Don't disregard unseemly motivations. One of the most powerful is the desire to be better than other people at something. Hardy said that's what got him started, and I think the only unusual thing about him is that he admitted it. Another powerful motivator is the desire to do, or know, things you're not supposed to. Closely related is the desire to do something audacious. Sixteen year olds aren't supposed to write novels. So if you try, anything you achieve is on the plus side of the ledger; if you fail utterly, you're doing no worse than expectations. [8]

不要忽视内心的“不良”动机。希望在某些方面超过其他人，是最强大的动机之一。哈迪说这就是他选择数学的原因。我觉得他这个人唯一独特之处，就是乐于承认这一点。对了解、掌握自己所不应了解的未知事物的渴望，是另一种强大的动机。与此紧密相连的是对【放个大新闻】的渴望。16岁本来就不是写小说的年龄，所以如果你写了，获得的任何成就都是锦上添花；而就算你彻底失败，也并没有输给其他人。

Beware of bad models. Especially when they excuse laziness. When I was in high school I used to write "existentialist" short stories like ones I'd seen by famous writers. My stories didn't have a lot of plot, but they were very deep. And they were less work to write than entertaining ones would have been. I should have known that was a danger sign. And in fact I found my stories pretty boring; what excited me was the idea of writing serious, intellectual stuff like the famous writers.

对于坏榜样要提高警惕。尤其要小心那些方便你找借口偷懒的。我上高中的时候，就曾经模仿过当年那些著名作家，写过一些“存在主义”短篇。我的故事没有什么情节，但是意味很深邃，*而且比那些有趣的故事要好写得多。* 我当时并没有发现这是个危险的信号。后来我才意识到我写的文章全都很无聊；不过是那种模仿著名作家写严肃、深刻的文章的想法，在背后激励着我。

Now I have enough experience to realize that those famous writers actually sucked. Plenty of famous people do; in the short term, the quality of one's work is only a small component of fame. I should have been less worried about doing something that seemed cool, and just done something I liked. That's the actual road to coolness anyway.

现在我经验丰富了，知道这些所谓著名作家，其实都是吹出来的。很多名人都是吹出来的；正红的时候，作品的质量不过是他名气的一小部分罢了。我当年不应该那么关心如何装逼，而应该做我真正喜欢的事情。把自己喜欢的事情做到极致，不也一样可以装逼吗？

A key ingredient in many projects, almost a project on its own, is to find good books. Most books are bad. Nearly all textbooks are bad. [9] So don't assume a subject is to be learned from whatever book on it happens to be closest. You have to search actively for the tiny number of good books.

大多数项目的关键——甚至本身就可以当做一个项目——是找到好的书。大多数书都写的不好，课本则几乎没有一本写得好的。所以不要觉得随手拿一本离你最近的书就能学好一个主题。你必须主动寻找那些数量稀少的好书。

The important thing is to get out there and do stuff. Instead of waiting to be taught, go out and learn.

记住，要动起来，做点实事。不要等别人来教你，要在主动地学习。

Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers. It could be shaped by your own curiosity. It is for all ambitious adults. And you don't have to wait to start. In fact, you don't have to wait to be an adult. There's no switch inside you that magically flips when you turn a certain age or graduate from some institution. You start being an adult when you decide to take responsibility for your life. You can do that at any age. [10]

何必让招生办的人帮你塑造生活？你可以用你的好奇心塑造它。每个志存高远的成年人都是这么做的，而你现在就可以动手开始。说实话，你们根本没必要等待成人——你们的身体不会一到18岁，或者大学一毕业，就发生什么神奇的变化。当你决定对你的人生负责的时候，你就开始成为成年人了。这和年龄是没有关系的。

This may sound like bullshit. I'm just a minor, you may think, I have no money, I have to live at home, I have to do what adults tell me all day long. Well, most adults labor under restrictions just as cumbersome, and they manage to get things done. If you think it's restrictive being a kid, imagine having kids.

刚才这些话听着可能比较扯淡。你可能会觉得，我还未成年，一没有钱，二只能住在家里，大人让我做什么我就得一天到晚做什么。好吧，其实大多数成年人也是在差不多讨厌的各种限制条件下工作的，而他们会想方设法地把事情做好。如果你们觉得做小孩麻烦，想象一下带小孩有多麻烦吧。

The only real difference between adults and high school kids is that adults realize they need to get things done, and high school kids don't. That realization hits most people around 23. But I'm letting you in on the secret early. So get to work. Maybe you can be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't how much time you wasted.

高中生和成年人的真正差别，是成年人知道他们必须得把事情做好，而高中生不知道。大多数人会在23岁左右明白这一点。然而我提前跟你们透露了这个秘密。去干点实事吧！也许你们会成为，高中最后悔的事情不是浪费了多少时间，的第一代人。


Notes
脚注

[1] A doctor friend warns that even this can give an inaccurate picture. "Who knew how much time it would take up, how little autonomy one would have for endless years of training, and how unbelievably annoying it is to carry a beeper?"

一个做医生的朋友提醒我，就算这样获得的印象也不一定是准确的。“你无法理解，要花多长时间，接受多少年的培训之后才能得到多么微小的一点自由，以及出门不离BP机到底有多TM地烦？”

[2] His best bet would probably be to become dictator and intimidate the NBA into letting him play. So far the closest anyone has come is Secretary of Labor.

我认为他的最佳方案应该是先成为独裁者，然后威胁NBA让他参赛。截止目前为止，最接近这个方案的人是劳动部部长。

[3] A day job is one you take to pay the bills so you can do what you really want, like play in a band, or invent relativity.

Treating high school as a day job might actually make it easier for some students to get good grades. If you treat your classes as a game, you won't be demoralized if they seem pointless.

However bad your classes, you need to get good grades in them to get into a decent college. And that is worth doing, because universities are where a lot of the clumps of smart people are these days.

【正职】就是那份你用来填饱肚子的职业——然后你就可以做你真正想做的事情，比如成立乐队，或者发明相对论。

实际上，把高中当成一份正职，反而会让一部分学生更容易获得好成绩——如果你能把你的科目当成游戏一场，你就不会因为他们看上去毫无意义而丧失兴趣了。

不管你的课程有多无聊，你都必须在取得好成绩才能进入好的大学。这是值得的，因为如今大量的聪明人都群聚在大学里。

[4] The second biggest regret was caring so much about unimportant things. And especially about what other people thought of them.

I think what they really mean, in the latter case, is caring what random people thought of them. Adults care just as much what other people think, but they get to be more selective about the other people.

I have about thirty friends whose opinions I care about, and the opinion of the rest of the world barely affects me. The problem in high school is that your peers are chosen for you by accidents of age and geography, rather than by you based on respect for their judgement.

第二后悔的事情，是过于关心那些并不重要的事情。尤其是关心别人对他们的看法。

我觉得他们后半句真正想说的是，过于关心一般人对他们的看法。成年人同样会关心他人的看法，但他们知道要对“他人”有所选择。

我身边大概有三十个朋友的意见是我比较关心的，剩下的整个世界对我基本没有影响。高中的问题关键就在于，你的同学是根据年龄和户口筛选的，而不是根据你对他们观点的尊重。

[5] The key to wasting time is distraction. Without distractions it's too obvious to your brain that you're not doing anything with it, and you start to feel uncomfortable. If you want to measure how dependent you've become on distractions, try this experiment: set aside a chunk of time on a weekend and sit alone and think. You can have a notebook to write your thoughts down in, but nothing else: no friends, TV, music, phone, IM, email, Web, games, books, newspapers, or magazines. Within an hour most people will feel a strong craving for distraction.

浪费时间的关键在于分心。没有东西让你分心的时候，你的大脑马上就能感觉到它被闲置，而让你感到局促不安。如果你想知道有多少事情能让你分心，可以做一下这个实验：找个周末，抽一段时间用来静坐。你可以用笔记本记录你的想法，但仅此而已：没有朋友，电视，音乐，手机，微信，邮件，网页，游戏，书，报纸，或者杂志。大多数人在一个小时内就会开始对分心之物产生强烈的需求。

[6] I don't mean to imply that the only function of prep schools is to trick admissions officers. They also generally provide a better education. But try this thought experiment: suppose prep schools supplied the same superior education but had a tiny (.001) negative effect on college admissions. How many parents would still send their kids to them?

我并不是暗示说那些预科学校的唯一用途就是骗取招生办的信任。它们总的来说还是提供了更好的教育。但你可以换一个角度思考：假如预科学校提供同样好的教育，但会对大学录取产生一点微小的（0.001）负面效果。有多少家长还会把他们的小孩送过去？

It might also be argued that kids who went to prep schools, because they've learned more, are better college candidates. But this seems empirically false. What you learn in even the best high school is rounding error compared to what you learn in college. Public school kids arrive at college with a slight disadvantage, but they start to pull ahead in the sophomore year.

可能有人会说，那些预科学校的学生学得更多，所以成为了更好的大学申请人。但从经验来看不是这样的。就算读的是最好的高中，你能学到的东西，连大学知识的一个零头都算不上。公立学校的学生刚入学会有一点微小的差距，但从大二开始他们就领先了。

(I'm not saying public school kids are smarter than preppies, just that they are within any given college. That follows necessarily if you agree prep schools improve kids' admissions prospects.)

（我不是说公立学校的学生比预科生聪明，我是说在所有的大学里都是这样。既然预科学校的作用是提升入学成功率，出现这种现象就不难理解了。）

[7] Why does society foul you? Indifference, mainly. There are simply no outside forces pushing high school to be good. The air traffic control system works because planes would crash otherwise. Businesses have to deliver because otherwise competitors would take their customers. But no planes crash if your school sucks, and it has no competitors. High school isn't evil; it's random; but random is pretty bad.

为什么社会要对你犯规？主要是因为无所谓。就根本没有任何外部力量去推动高中提高教学水平。空中交通管制系统必须正常工作，因为不正常就会出人命。各行各业必须按时交付，不然竞争者就会带走客户。但你的学校不管多烂，都不会出人命，也没有竞争者。总之高中并不是故意伤害；它只是任你自生自灭；但自生自灭其实挺惨的。

[8] And then of course there is money. It's not a big factor in high school, because you can't do much that anyone wants. But a lot of great things were created mainly to make money. Samuel Johnson said "no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money." (Many hope he was exaggerating.)

还有一个就是钱。这在高中不是主要因素，反正你也写不出什么能赚钱的东西。但很多伟大的作品都是以赚钱为主要目的而创作的。用萨缪尔·约翰逊的话说，“不以赚钱为目的的写作都是耍流氓”（很多人宁愿相信他是故意夸张）。

[9] Even college textbooks are bad. When you get to college, you'll find that (with a few stellar exceptions) the textbooks are not written by the leading scholars in the field they describe. Writing college textbooks is unpleasant work, done mostly by people who need the money. It's unpleasant because the publishers exert so much control, and there are few things worse than close supervision by someone who doesn't understand what you're doing. This phenomenon is apparently even worse in the production of high school textbooks.

大学的教材也很糟糕。当你进到大学的时候，你会发现教科书（个别神作除外）并不是由具体领域内的顶尖学者撰写的。写大学教材是份很不爽的工作，通常是由那些需要赚这个钱的人完成的。不爽是因为出版社施加太多限制，有什么能比让一帮不明白你在干嘛的人监督你更糟糕呢？这个现象在高中教材的制作过程中就更加突出了。

[10] Your teachers are always telling you to behave like adults. I wonder if they'd like it if you did. You may be loud and disorganized, but you're very docile compared to adults. If you actually started acting like adults, it would be just as if a bunch of adults had been transposed into your bodies. Imagine the reaction of an FBI agent or taxi driver or reporter to being told they had to ask permission to go the bathroom, and only one person could go at a time. To say nothing of the things you're taught. If a bunch of actual adults suddenly found themselves trapped in high school, the first thing they'd do is form a union and renegotiate all the rules with the administration.

你们的老师总是要求你们表现得像个大人。我觉得他们未必真的这么想。也许你很吵很闹，但实际上你比大人乖多了。如果你们表现得像真正的大人，那就等于把一群大人转换到你们的身体里。想象一下，如果一名警察、一位的士司机或者一个记者，听说上厕所之前必须打报告，而且一次只能去一个人，对教学内容不能发表任何意见，会有什么反应。如果一群大人突然发现自己被困在高中里，他们会干的第一件事就是组织工会，然后跟校方针对所有校规进行重新谈判。
